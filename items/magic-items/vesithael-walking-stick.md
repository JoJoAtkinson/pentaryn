# Vesithael's (VEH-sith-AY-el) Walking Stick

> A staff of living elven oak, its grain spiraling with the memory of centuries. The wood still feels warm, as though sunlight never quite leaves it.

| **Value** | 250 gp |

## Description

The Vesithael Walking Stick is carved from a single piece of elven oak, harvested with permission from the ancient groves. Its surface bears no tool marks—the wood shaped itself according to old pacts between druids and the forest. The grain spirals like water, catching the light in ways that suggest movement even when the staff is still.

When held, the stick feels unnaturally warm, as if it still carries the sunlight it absorbed over hundreds of years. Fine silver veins run through the wood, not inlaid but grown naturally, marking ley-line connections to the forests where it was born.

## Properties & Mechanics

### Basic Properties

- **Damage:** 1d6 bludgeoning (or 1d8 versatile)
- **Properties:** Versatile

### Magic Properties

#### Nature's Companion

While attuned, the wielder gains advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate or forage in forested terrain. The staff subtly guides its bearer toward safe paths and edible plants.

#### Living Wood

The staff can be used as a spellcasting focus for druid or ranger spells. When used to cast a spell that restores hit points or removes a condition, the target regains an additional 1d4 hit points (once per day).

#### Root Sense

Once per day, the wielder can plant the staff in natural earth and cast *Speak with Plants* without expending a spell slot. The staff must remain planted for the duration.

## History & Lore

### Creation

The Vesithael Walking Stick was grown, not carved, in the elven groves near the ancient forests. Druids would select a sapling and sing to it over decades, guiding its shape through ritual and patience. The silver veins formed naturally as the tree drew power from ley-line confluences.

This particular staff was shaped for an elven druid named Vesithael (VEH-sith-AY-el), who walked the boundaries between settled lands and the wild, mediating disputes between farmers and forest spirits.

### Legend

It's said that any staff bearing Vesithael's name was given freely by the forest itself. The trees marked those druids worthy of carrying their wood across great distances, trusting them to remember the green places even when surrounded by stone and steel.

## Attunement Details

- **Requirements:** Druid or ranger class
- **Attunement Process:** Meditate with the staff for one hour in a natural setting (forest, meadow, or garden). The staff will feel warmer when attunement succeeds.

## Current Status

**Owner:** Unclaimed
**Location:** Unknown (possibly in circulation among druids or found in ancient ruins)

## DM Notes

### Use in Play

This staff is ideal for:
- Rewarding druids/rangers who respect nature
- Found in elven ruins or ancient groves
- Gift from grateful forest spirits or druids
- Purchased from traveling elven merchants

### Balance Notes

The +1d4 healing boost is limited to once per day, keeping it useful but not overpowered at low-to-mid tiers. The *Speak with Plants* ability provides utility without combat power.
