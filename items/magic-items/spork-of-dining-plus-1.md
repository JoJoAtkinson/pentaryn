## Description

> You see a gleaming utensil made of polished silver, with fork tines on one end and a shallow spoon bowl on the other. Faint arcane runes are etched along its handle, glowing softly with a warm, inviting light.

This curious hybrid eating utensil appears to be crafted from enchanted silver, with expert craftsmanship that makes it perfectly balanced for both combat and dining. The fork tines are sharp enough to pierce food (or foes), while the spoon bowl is deep enough to scoop soup or stew. The handle is wrapped in fine leather for a comfortable grip, and the magical runes emit a faint warmth that keeps food at the perfect temperature.

## History & Lore

Legend says the Spork of Dining was created by a eccentric wizard-chef who grew tired of carrying multiple utensils on adventures. After countless experiments combining utility with combat practicality, the first enchanted spork was born. They became popular among adventuring gourmands who refused to sacrifice fine dining for dungeon delving.
