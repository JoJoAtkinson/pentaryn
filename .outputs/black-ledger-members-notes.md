# Grek Bar'Kar (GREK bar-KAR)

> “It’s not evil. It’s engineering.”

## Snapshot

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party** | The Black Ledger |
| **Ancestry** | Dwarf |
| **Origin** | Garhammar |
| **Class / Level** | Artificer 2 |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Neutral |
| **Background** | Guild engineer |
| **Party Role** | Wards / tools |

## Public Profile

- Talks like a foreman: short sentences, measured anger, constant assessment.
- Keeps his gear spotless; his hands are always nicked from fine work.
- The only one who looks uneasy when the Ledger “collects.”

## Mechanics (Level 2 Artificer)

*Baseline:* written to be quick at the table, using a “standard 5e Artificer” assumption (Tasha-style). If your campaign is using a different Artificer write-up, treat this as a scaffold and we’ll swap specifics.

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| **Proficiency Bonus** | +2 |
| **Hit Dice** | 2d8 |
| **Spellcasting Ability** | Intelligence |
| **Spell Save DC** | 8 + PB (+2) + INT mod |
| **Spell Attack** | PB (+2) + INT mod |
| **Spell Slots** | 2× 1st-level |
| **Cantrips Known** | 2 |
| **Prepared Spells** | INT mod + 1 |

### Class Features (quick list)

- **Magical Tinkering:** minor gadget-magic on a tiny object (marking, light, sound, recorded message, odor, etc.).
- **Spellcasting:** prepares spells from the artificer list; uses tools as casting focus.
- **Infuse Item:** knows 4 infusions; can have 2 infused items active at once.

### Infusions (suggested, “wards/tools”)

**Known (4):**
- **Enhanced Defense** (armor/shield)
- **Mind Sharpener** (armor; helps keep concentration)
- **Repeating Shot** (crossbow/firearm, if you use those rules)
- **Replicate Magic Item** (pick one: *Bag of Holding* is the most universally useful)

**Active (2):**
- Enhanced Defense on his armor/shield
- Replicate Magic Item (Bag of Holding) on his pack

### Spells (suggested loadout)

**Cantrips:** *mending*, *guidance*.

**Prepared (INT mod + 1):** pick from practical worksite magic like *detect magic*, *cure wounds*, *faerie fire*, *alarm*, *sanctuary* (exact list depends on which artificer list you’re using at your table).

## Methods

- Builds quick wards and rigged tools that make bad choices survivable.
- Prefers prevention: wedges, lines, chalk-marks, and redundant failsafes.
- Treats every ruin like a collapsing worksite, not a battlefield.

## Leverage & Tells

- **Debt-trap:** his guild contract can repossess his work, his tools, and his name—Vessa keeps a copy.
- He hates cruelty, but he hates bankruptcy more.
- When he lies, he over-explains the mechanics.

## Hooks

- Quietly slips a PC a warning about a trap the Ledger plans to “let happen.”
- Offers a repair at cost… then asks for help clearing a debt clause he can’t afford to fight alone.
- Is the easiest member to flip: not by mercy, but by a better contract.

# Maela Thorn

> “Curses are just contracts the soul didn’t read.”

## Snapshot

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party** | The Black Ledger |
| **Ancestry** | Human |
| **Origin** | Elderholt |
| **Class / Level** | Warlock 3 |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Evil |
| **Background** | Coven debtor |
| **Party Role** | Occult / curses |

## Spellwork (Warlock 3)

> *Her magic is paperwork with teeth.*

| Spellcasting | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Ability** | Charisma |
| **Spell save DC** | `8 + proficiency bonus + CHA mod` |
| **Spell attack** | `proficiency bonus + CHA mod` |
| **Pact slots** | `2` slots (cast at **2nd level**) |
| **Typical tells** | Blackened ink under the nails; whispered clauses; a sigil written, then blotted |

### Cantrips (at-will)

- **Eldritch Blast** — her “collection notice.”
- **Minor Illusion** — false omens, forged “signs,” and misdirection.

### Spells known (pick 4; cast using pact slots)

- **Armor of Agathys** — punishment for anyone who grabs what isn’t theirs.
- **Hex** — the debt becomes a weakness.
- **Invisibility** — leave before the conversation turns violent.
- **Suggestion** — contracts, gently enforced.

### Optional swaps (if you want her sharper in a given scene)

- **Charm Person** (social leverage)
- **Disguise Self** (identity as a commodity)
- **Hellish Rebuke** (the moment someone “breaks terms”)
- **Darkness** (covering an exit or isolating a mark)
- **Mirror Image** (survive the consequences)

## Combat Stats

> HP, saves, and proficiencies assume average rolls for a Warlock 3 with the following mental focus and defenses.

| Trait | Value |
|---|---|
| **HP** | `24` (3d8; 8 + 2 × (avg. 5 + 2) with Con 14) |
| **Hit Dice** | 3d8 |
| **AC** | `13` (Mage Armor, Dex 12) |
| **Speed** | 30 ft |
| **Ability mods** | Str 8 (−1), Dex 12 (+1), Con 14 (+2), Int 13 (+1), Wis 10 (+0), Cha 16 (+3) |
| **Saving Throws** | Wisdom +2 (Proficiency + Wisdom), Charisma +5 |
| **Skills / Tools** | Arcana +3, Deception +5, Insight +2, Investigation +3 |
| **Spellcasting** | Spell save DC 13, Spell attack +5 (CHA-based) |
| **Equipment** | Quarterstaff (focus), dagger, components pouch, scroll of minor runes |

### Notes

- Mage Armor keeps her nimble; Mark the Charisma bonus when she threatens curses.
- A failed wrath–style strike still leaves her resistances intact (no rage, so no resistances).

## Public Profile

- Smiles too politely when someone mentions “blessings.”
- Smells faintly of smoke and dried herbs; her fingertips are stained dark.
- Treats taboo knowledge like inventory: sorted, priced, and ready to move.

## Methods

- Identifies what a relic *does*, what it *costs*, and who will pay to take the cost.
- Uses fear as a tool—quietly, surgically—never wasting it.
- Keeps a charm for every job and a clause for every charm.

## Leverage & Tells

- She never says her patron’s name out loud; she writes it and then blots the ink.
- She is fast to sell cursed items to the “right” buyer, slow to destroy anything.
- When she’s worried, she counts under her breath.

## Hooks

- Offers to “lift” a curse from a PC—for a favor that becomes a debt.
- Knows a black-market buyer who pays extra for relics that still bite.
- Recognizes an omen in the ruins and pushes the party toward the most profitable danger.

# Orren Pike

> “I don’t argue. I collect.”

## Snapshot

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party** | The Black Ledger |
| **Ancestry** | Human |
| **Origin** | Ardenhaven |
| **Class / Level** | Fighter 3 |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Evil |
| **Background** | Deserter |
| **Party Role** | Muscle / enforcer |

## Class Build (Fighter 3)

> “Keep to the plan and keep them in range.”

- **Fighting Style:** *Dueling* (bonus +2 damage when he fights with a single martial weapon and no shield, reinforcing his reputation for precise strikes rather than swinging wildly).
- **Second Wind:** Bonus action to regain `1d10 + level` HP once per short rest—he uses this when a scrape would otherwise slow the ledger’s pace.
- **Action Surge:** Once per short rest, he can take an extra action, letting him close, shove, grapple, or land a heavy finish before a mark escapes.
- **Martial Archetype:** *Champion* — favors brutal efficiency: improved crit range (19–20) and later Remarkable Athlete growth make him a walking threat and a steady guard.
- **Gear lane:** prefers a well-balanced longsword/bastard weapon for finishing blows, a light crossbow for distance, and studded armor with a reinforced cloak (adds intimidation plus cover).
- **Tactics:** positions himself to contest exits, uses Action Surge to end the fight on his terms, and keeps favor with the ledger by not taking unnecessary hits (Second Wind buys him time to keep the ledger’s ledger balanced).

## Combat Stats

> Brutal precision—these stats assume Fighter 3 with the given physical spread.

| Trait | Value |
|---|---|
| **HP** | `28` (3d10; 10 + 2 × (avg. 6 + 2) with Con 14) |
| **Hit Dice** | 3d10 |
| **AC** | `18` (Studded armor + Dueling, shield carried when he isn’t using his blade) |
| **Speed** | 30 ft |
| **Ability mods** | Str 16 (+3), Dex 12 (+1), Con 14 (+2), Int 10 (+0), Wis 11 (+0), Cha 9 (−1) |
| **Saving Throws** | Strength +5, Constitution +4 |
| **Skills / Tools** | Athletics +5, Intimidation +1 |
| **Equipment** | Longsword (dueling), light crossbow, handaxe, shield, ledger-branded cloak |

### Notes

- Action Surge opens a second attack or shove before the enemy flees; Second Wind keeps him standing in the doorway.

## Public Profile

- Quiet, squared shoulders, eyes that don’t blink when someone lies.
- Talks little; when he does, it’s the last warning.
- Keeps watch like he’s still on a wall-walk.

## Methods

- Stands where he can block doors, corridors, and escape lines.
- Enforces “terms” with restraint: a broken hand today is a living debtor tomorrow.
- Lets Vessa talk; he finishes conversations.

## Leverage & Tells

- He avoids Ardenhaven uniforms and official seals like a superstition.
- If someone invokes “duty,” his jaw tightens before he answers.
- He’s loyal to the ledger because it’s simple: pay what you owe, or pay more.

## Hooks

- Recognizes a PC as “the kind that runs” and offers “protection” at interest.
- Takes a personal dislike to any authority figure who claims to be incorruptible.
- Offers to “settle” a debt with violence the moment the paperwork clears.

# Vessa Kain

> “Sign, then bleed. In that order.”

## Snapshot

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party** | The Black Ledger |
| **Ancestry** | Human |
| **Origin** | Merrowgate |
| **Class / Level** | Rogue 4 |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Evil |
| **Background** | Guild fixer |
| **Party Role** | Boss / planner |

## Class Build (Rogue 4)

> “A deal doesn’t close until you can disappear with the ledger and the witness.”

- **Expertise:** Doubles proficiency in Investigation and Persuasion, turning her “terms” into actionable evidence and giving her the charm to close the ledger’s sales.
- **Sneak Attack (2d6):** Built for the rapier/hand crossbow dance—if she can tease out advantage, or keep a teammate opposite a mark, the “pen” cut hits like a strike.
- **Thieves’ Cant & Tools:** Always has thieves’ tools, a disguise kit, and the shorthand symbols of the underworld. She reads a room and writes a warning in the same breath.
- **Cunning Action:** Bonus-action Dash/Disengage/Hide every turn keeps her three steps ahead of angry debtors or lawmen.
- **Roguish Archetype — Thief:** Fast Hands, Second-Story Work, and future Supreme Sneak all reinforce her fixer reputation—she can “adjust” settlements without breaking stride and vanish before the mess shows up.
- **Ability Score Improvement:** Split between Dexterity and Charisma to keep her movement precise and her words persuasive.
- **Tactics:** Let others open the fight; she stays in the mess, exploits flanking, then vanishes, keeping witnesses useful rather than dead.

## Combat Stats

> These assumed stats make Rogue 4 ready for a ledger-friendly skirmish; adjust if you roll differently.

| Trait | Value |
|---|---|
| **HP** | `27` (4d8; 8 + 3 × (avg. 5 + 1) with Con 12) |
| **Hit Dice** | 4d8 |
| **AC** | `15` (Sturdy studded armor, Dex 18) |
| **Speed** | 30 ft |
| **Ability mods** | Str 8 (−1), Dex 18 (+4), Con 12 (+1), Int 14 (+2), Wis 10 (+0), Cha 14 (+2) |
| **Saving Throws** | Dexterity +6, Intelligence +4 |
| **Skills / Tools** | Expertise in Investigation (+6) and Persuasion (+4), plus Stealth +6, Insight +2, thieves' tools, disguise kit |
| **Sneak Attack** | 2d6 once per turn (with a finesse/ranged attack and advantage or nearby ally) |
| **Special** | Cunning Action (Dash/Disengage/Hide bonus action), Thief fast hands, Second-Story Work |
| **Equipment** | Rapier, hand crossbow, ledger-branded cloak, ledger-hiding case |

### Notes

- She uses Sneak Attack support from Orren/Zor’gar; keep her in cover and out of direct charge.

## Public Profile

- Always calm. Always “reasonable.” Always taking notes.
- Dresses like a clerk, moves like a knife.
- Speaks in *terms*: obligations, defaults, penalties, collateral.

## Methods

- Uses written contracts to make violence feel “official.”
- Prefers leverage over blood, but keeps an exit route for both.
- Keeps multiple identities for Ardenford work: a “broker,” a “scribe,” and a “client.”

## Leverage & Tells

- Carries a small book of pre-written clauses; she only changes names and numbers.
- If the deal gets messy, she offers a path to compliance before she offers a threat.
- Her strongest fear is *uncontrolled loss*: fire, panic, and anything that can’t be accounted for.

## Hooks

- Offers the party a clean cut on a ruin… with a clause that makes them the “liable subcontractor.”
- Sells information about a competitor’s route—then sells the competitor the party’s name.
- “Accidentally” leaves a page of the ledger where a curious PC will find it.

# Zor'gar (ZOR-gar)

> “Honor doesn’t buy bandages.”

## Snapshot

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party** | The Black Ledger |
| **Ancestry** | Orc |
| **Origin** | Garrok |
| **Class / Level** | Barbarian 3 |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Evil |
| **Background** | Oathbreaker |
| **Party Role** | Breach / intimidation |

## Class Build (Barbarian 3)

> “Rage settles debts quicker than a ledger ever could.”

- **Rage:** Bonus action to enter rage (3/day), granting advantage on Strength checks/Saves, resistance to bludgeoning/piercing/slashing, and bonus damage that reflects his brute-force signature. He keeps it until the target is down or he’s forced out of melee.
- **Unarmored Defense:** Wears no heavy armor—just reinforced war paint and a heavy cloak—keeping AC = 10 + Dex + Con while still brandishing a greataxe/maul.
- **Reckless Attack:** Opens attacks with advantage, trading defense for more consistent hits and maximizing the Ledger’s intimidation.
- **Danger Sense:** Advantage on visible Dex saves keeps him from getting surprised by traps or backstabs while he’s the charging force.
- **Primal Path – Berserker:** Frenzy lets him swing again with a bonus action (exhaustion after rage ends), matching his “never stop until the job is done” persona.
- **Equipment & Tactics:** Carries a maul, grenades of rending metal, and a reinforced shielded cloak separately. Charges doorways, uses Rage/ Frenzy to push through crowd control, and lets Orren clean up any precision work.

## Combat Stats

> These values let Barbarian 3 stay “monster” on the front line while the ledger writes the invoice for fear.

| Trait | Value |
|---|---|
| **HP** | `35` (3d12; 12 + 2 × (avg. 7 + 3) with Con 16) |
| **Hit Dice** | 3d12 |
| **AC** | `15` (Unarmored Defense: 10 + Dex 14 + Con 16) |
| **Speed** | 30 ft |
| **Ability mods** | Str 16 (+3), Dex 14 (+2), Con 16 (+3), Int 8 (−1), Wis 12 (+1), Cha 10 (+0) |
| **Saving Throws** | Strength +5, Constitution +5 |
| **Skills / Tools** | Athletics +5, Intimidation +2 |
| **Rage** | 3/day; +2 damage bonus, resistance to bludgeoning/piercing/slashing while raging |
| **Primal Path – Berserker** | Frenzy (bonus-action attack while raging, exhaustion after each rage ends) |
| **Equipment** | Maul, pair of handaxes, reinforced cloak, grenades of rending metal |

### Notes

- Reckless Attack trades defense for more chances to land a maul, especially when he activates Frenzy.

## Public Profile

- Laughs at threats, respects payment, remembers insults.
- Loud on purpose: he wants people to feel him coming.
- Keeps trophies that are practical—buckles, keys, rings—not sentimental.

## Methods

- Breaks lines and doors, then dares someone to stop him.
- Prefers intimidation to killing: fear makes compliance cheaper.
- Plays the “monster” role because it keeps bargaining simple.

## Leverage & Tells

- His “oath” wasn’t sacred; it was a bargain he chose not to pay.
- He follows Vessa’s rules because they protect his share.
- He’s easy to provoke when someone calls him predictable.

## Hooks

- Picks a fight to cover the Ledger’s retreat, then charges for the “service.”
- Offers a brutal solution to a moral problem—framed as “efficiency.”
- A rival tries to buy him away mid-job; he treats it as normal negotiation.
