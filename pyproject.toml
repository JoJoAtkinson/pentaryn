# Notes on native text layout (RAQM):
# - On macOS, install native libs first:
#     brew install libraqm harfbuzz fribidi freetype
# - Pillow only enables RAQM if it's built from source *after* those libs are installed.
# - uv config below forces Pillow to build from source (no wheel), allowing RAQM detection.
