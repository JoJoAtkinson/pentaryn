[SPEAKER_00]
except not really.
There are action?

[SPEAKER_03]
There will be action.
We will fight things.
Okay.
It's picking up everything now.
It's very sensitive to make sure it picks up everything.
Okay, continue.
Well, I would like to take the lead on looking for an old dwarf this morning since I have some familiarity with them.
I at least know in general how they might dress or look different from Garhammer.
Okay.
So...
Because we were just told to find one.
I know we had...
I guess we were just told to look for an Oath Hold Dwarf by the Archivist yesterday, but he didn't actually have a lead for this.
Specifically one who does Sherpa work.
Yeah.
Investigation.
Perception's unrelated.
Not great.
Ten.
Ten?
Ugh.
Should have chose the difficulty first.
I'll go with it was easy since I didn't pick.
I generally, if I don't pick the DC first hand, I get, I go whatever I want and go one step further down because I know I'm more than biased.
Yeah.
That's why I sound a little sad.

[SPEAKER_02]
Disappointed myself.

[SPEAKER_03]
Disappointed myself.
I didn't pick it beforehand.
Not to act against my own teammate, but yesterday you did imply that it was hard.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
You could justify it, yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah.
You know what?
I'll just move the difficulty to convincing him to come.
Okay.
That's fair.
Because we're nobodies who, you know, aren't exciting and probably don't pay as well.

[UNKNOWN]
I know.

[SPEAKER_02]
and try to negotiate the terms dwarves don't seem to take.

[SPEAKER_00]
Does this mean I have to negotiate a contract?

[SPEAKER_01]
You speak Dwarven?

[SPEAKER_00]
Yes, I speak Dwarven, but I don't do contract.
I just, you do a thing, and we give you a thing.
Don't worry, I've got this.

[SPEAKER_03]
Don't sign papers.
So, all right, so we're going to try to find a oath hold contract.
Sherpa slash guide for the ruins.
Sure, you find one named, what's the problem with eating and gaming?
And I'm getting a name.
Oh, and I told her to think extra hard.
You don't need to think extra hard for a blogging buddy.
Just generate me something.
This crust came out actually good.
I mean, it's done, but it's...
I don't know.
Different?
What do you think of it?

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm happy.

[SPEAKER_03]
Good.
Yeah, it's spicy.
What was it?
Did we get a name for the alfalfa dwarf yet?
No.
Okay, cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
I think I just added more flour than I should have.
It's fine.
I haven't used a name called Gorgondor yet, have I?
Gorgondor?
Gorgondor?
Yeah.
No.
Okay.
His name is Gorgondor.
Okay.
Can you spell that?
No.
Okay.
Can you put it in the Discord?
I'll put it in Discord.
Okay.
Yes, I could put every letter.
I'm just not willing to.
There's the spelling.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, make sure it's a name you're going to potentially be happy with long term, Joe.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yep, because we're looking to make a relationship.
None of the names are names I'm happy long term.
I just deal with it.
If I was to make names I'm happy with, they'll all be like Ted, John, Joe.
G. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can barely say our names.

[SPEAKER_02]
You can make every NPC named Joe, and then we're just, you know immediately we're talking.

[SPEAKER_03]
You just don't know which Joe we're talking to.
Hey, Joe, just realizing that every one of your names just seems like a random storm in four letters.
What?
That's weird.
That's strange.
So, where do we find Car-Gorm-Dor?
Car-Grom-Dor.

[SPEAKER_01]
Car-Grom-Dor.

[SPEAKER_03]
Car-Grom-Dor.
you're gonna find him even even he, he is actually literally there's just this, you know, have you ever like, you see how people climb mountains is like spots where you'll find people collecting like, almost like there's a in a tavern, like a bar, it's more like a bar than an end, where they know to be to be found for exactly this.
And so
You find him amongst a whole bunch of other dwarfs that are more contractual based, all in the same spot.
We're going to call this place...
It's the...
I'm trying to think of a good dwarven name.
You know what they call it?
The stone bird.
And it kind of plays on the, like, it's stone, because it's dwarven, and it's bird, because the dwarves take you high up into the mountains like birds.
It is all dwarven.
Like, it's just all dwarven.
And your easy check got you where you could, you could figure out which of the dwarves was from under, from... Dogrun.
Dogrun.
Because...
Basically, you knew just enough to know that they don't like each other, and you see this dwarf that appears to be oil to all the water.
He just, he looks exactly like everybody else, but you just notice that there's like all the other dwarfs conversing.
Him, he's just alone, drinking his ale, and doing, and seems just content.

[SPEAKER_02]
I love you too, Golem, without me.
I will wait across the room.
Okay.
Well, you don't want to come in the door, then, please?

[SPEAKER_01]
That's fine.

[SPEAKER_02]
I could, but I don't want to skew things and make it harder.

[SPEAKER_03]
Shoot.
How do you spell Sherpa?
Sherpa.
Uh, S-H-E-R-P-A.
Okay, all right.
Good job, Joe.
We're proud of you.
Proud of myself?
I'll pat myself on the back on that.
I know you're sarcastic, but I...
It wasn't entirely sarcastic.
Joe, what's a traditional reading of Oath Hold Doors?
Um, you owe me a knowledge of religion, I guess?

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay.
Not Arcana?
I don't know what this is, but...

[SPEAKER_03]
It's still religion.
I cannot roll very well today.
Eight.
Well, I will remind you, I have met some of these guys before.
You have, but they may not be from the same clan.
Do you speak Dwarven?
Yes.
You do speak Dwarven.
I do speak Dwarven.
It is, you remember, but you don't think, you know that if you try, you're going to get it wrong.
Okay.
But you're like, you just, you don't have that confidence.
Okay.
And if you wrote a one, I'd be like, yeah, you got it.
Go for it.
And then they'd be angry.

[SPEAKER_00]
Gotcha.

[SPEAKER_03]
But you got high enough to know that you...
I'm, like, shaky about it.
When I used to do it, it was more...
I had to get corrected.
Like, we're working on my pronunciation, and now I'm rusty.
Yeah, you used to be able to do the whole backhand shake, and now you're like, I can't do that shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, you said greeting, not reading.
Okay.
That's why I thought our comp that's my mom sugar alarm.

[SPEAKER_02]
She's on the urgent blow Yeah, take your time I apologize You need my father drive over and check on her No, Angela's just across the yard the the person in the Not the house directly behind
hands, but behind the wood side things is a neighbor who is comfortable going to check on her.
If available.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_02]
It was really good pizza, Joe.

[SPEAKER_00]
Excellent.
I'm glad to hear that.
If and when I get diabetic, don't let me get that level of diabetic.
I know you can't do it for me, obviously, but help me.

[SPEAKER_02]
It's not just a physical... Well, the conflict is physical, obviously, but the...
It does not make the best...
Choices for sustaining blood sugar.
Now she's she's got she is insulin dependent or insulin she uses.
She's not dependent on it.
I don't think but basically she doesn't want to accept the fact that spiking blood sugar is not the same as sustaining blood sugar.
So oftentimes she will turn to a short fix rather than a longer term solution.

[SPEAKER_00]
I remember you were saying that she would drink the juice.

[SPEAKER_02]
She uses juice to fix her blood sugar crashes, which only delays the inevitable.
And we've talked to her many, many times about follow your juice up with something that will keep it longer because she doesn't want to eat it.
Just want to eat if we're not there, really.

[SPEAKER_03]
I don't know much about diabetic.
I have a few questions.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah?
Okay.
I mean, I'm not an insulin dependent, so I'm on the lower end of the scale.
Like, when it comes to diabetes, like, I don't deal with any of that.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oh, I wasn't saying that if you had it.
I don't know what...
But if you have questions... Yeah, I was just curious if, like,
Can you be skinny and be diabetic?
Yes.

[SPEAKER_02]
Absolutely.
Okay.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
So it's not connected to being weight.
Does it have any connection with weight at all?

[SPEAKER_02]
It does.
It has a correlation.

[SPEAKER_00]
A correlation.
If you are overweight, you are more likely to develop it, but it is not a guarantee and it is not a... Yeah, that's the thing.

[SPEAKER_02]
Typically, it's a good indicator that you have some sort of hormone issue that could...
also could be related to diabetes.
But you can absolutely be skinny and diabetic and never even know.
And there's also two versions, two categories of diabetes.
Type 1 and 2.
Type 1 people are typically born with and it's not something they have any control over.

[SPEAKER_00]
It's basically pure genetics.
Lifestyle does not matter for that.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
And they actually have, it's funny because it's diabetes, but what they have is the opposite problem.
They don't have high blood sugar, they have low blood sugar.
They have consistently too low blood sugar and their body doesn't produce or doesn't make the way to maintain their blood sugar high enough to have a healthy functioning organs.
And that's where you get the failure because it's not something you feel.
Unless you have symptoms like dizziness.
There are symptomatic things you can feel, but you don't feel diabetic.
I can eat a cupcake or a carrot and not feel different between foods.
Okay.

[SPEAKER_03]
But you do know if your blood sugar gets too high.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
There are extremes where if my blood sugar spikes up very high, that will trigger a headache.
For me.
But that does not.
It's not the same for everybody.

[SPEAKER_03]
My mom.
Doesn't get it at all.

[SPEAKER_02]
She does not get it at all.

[SPEAKER_03]
Her sugar was outrageously high.
Landed her in the hospital.
So she doesn't know.
She's not fine.
Not if it's high.

[SPEAKER_02]
But if it's low she knows.
I only think I'm getting those headaches.
Because I started fine tuning my sensitivity to my insulin.
Because I made changes to my diet.
Because I didn't used to get them for sugar.
And now.
If I have a.
bunch of straight sugary, like a candy bar, like a sugary latte, and if I have like an overload, that's when I will get it.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
Mom, for the record, was doing good.
She actually did eat food.
She did not bite me on this, which is why I was calling because oftentimes there's been an argument with her lately where she just doesn't want to eat.
She just wants to drink juice and
Whatever, but the promised juice will quickly boost it up, but then she'll crash again.
But she had already finished off her spaghetti.
So she actually ate a carb, which was good.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, a lot of the visceral fat storage contains excess sugar.
And when you're losing weight, even as a diabetic, that can...
Like, that's why it's more considered cyclical or downgrading because, like, weight can play the factor in.
Your body's reserves are the thing you are still struggling with.
When you break down visceral fat, it actually has components of the hormones that upset your whole ecosystem, your blood sugar ecosystem, anyway.

[SPEAKER_03]
So losing fat means you are breaking down the thing that's causing you to be diabetic.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yes, but it's still healthier than maintaining it.
Because if you actually get to the point where you've reached a healthy weight... You don't want to crash.

[SPEAKER_01]
Yeah, you don't want to crash.

[SPEAKER_03]
If you're diabetic, you literally can't afford to crash.
Correct, yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
Okay.
Basically, it's...
So you know how insulin is just a thing that gets released into your bloodstream and...

[SPEAKER_03]
It's the sugar, right?

[SPEAKER_02]
It's what...

[SPEAKER_03]
It's a hormone that counteracts the sugar.

[SPEAKER_02]
Counteract sugar.
If you eat, your body uses so much of the sugar in your bloodstream.
If you have an excess of that, they produce insulin to flush it out or store it.
This is why a lot of people do gain weight with type 2 typically.
And then insulin is the combating factor to blood sugar.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay, so one last question.
If the type is not genetic, you gain weight, you become diabetic, but you lose weight and you're no longer diabetic?
Sometimes that happens.

[SPEAKER_02]
It is not a guarantee.
It's not common.

[SPEAKER_03]
So once it happens, you can always be diabetic.
Yes.

[SPEAKER_02]
And for the prevailing part of the era of our parents' knowledge of diabetes...
People assume once you're a diabetic, it's a progressive disease that you cannot fix.

[SPEAKER_01]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_02]
Now people understand it can be reversed in some cases, but the percent is like 30%.

[SPEAKER_03]
Even losing weight and having a better diet, you can at least reverse the severity of it.

[SPEAKER_02]
You can certainly control the severity through lifestyle.

[SPEAKER_03]
If it doesn't go away completely, you can be much healthier.
Like my mom even right now.
She'll never be cured.
There's no way with her age and what's going on.

[SPEAKER_02]
The trigger point is insulin.
If you have to go on insulin, you've crossed a threshold that is very hard to get back from.
Like, almost impossible, yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
But she has a device called the Dexcom that is constantly reading her blood sugar and reporting it to her phone.
Yeah, it's on her arm, and she has to switch it every 10 days because the sensor will die, the battery will die.
But...
It alerts her when her sugar gets too low or too high, helping to tell her when to eat.
It's taken her blood sugar from going between 40 and 650, and now she's routinely around like 70 and 200, which 100 to 200 is a pretty good range for her.

[SPEAKER_02]
Insulin can take your blood sugar too low.
Okay.
And that's the balancing factor.
That's what can kill you.
That cannot happen to me.
I can't have a blood sugar that's too low because I'm not on insulin, even though I could take like metformin is what I currently use.
That does not have the same effect as insulin.

[SPEAKER_03]
Whereas when that alarm goes off, so mine is intended to follow hers.
My alarms are set actually as very like, they won't really go off when something bad is happening.
She has to be low for a while or severely low before it alerts me.
Because if she gets too low, it's like she's drunk, and then she's unable to think or process or do anything, take care of herself.

[SPEAKER_02]
Because the parts inside your body don't have the energy, the material they need to function.
Your brain starts shutting down.

[SPEAKER_03]
And if that continues, then you go into what's called the diabetic coma, and there's a chance of death.

[SPEAKER_02]
Your body just starts shutting down.

[SPEAKER_03]
It's been low enough many times that we've had to call the rescue squad to revive her.
Wow.
That's why calling and bugging her when it starts to alert me, because it only does that when she's not taking care of it.

[SPEAKER_02]
But that is an insulin-dependent diabetic problem, not a non-insulin-dependent diabetic problem.
I couldn't stay here.
Even if I were to fast for a week, my body would not reach that state.
I could not eat for a week.

[SPEAKER_00]
My dad is diabetic.
He's on metformin, and you can't tell.
You can't tell.
You can't tell he's diabetic.
He can't tell he's diabetic.

[SPEAKER_02]
You don't feel it.
There's no feel component to it.

[SPEAKER_03]
Well, I've been educated.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Just go back to the game.
Christina's ready.
I'm going to also dispose of my plate so I have some more space.

[SPEAKER_02]
Sorry about the overload of information.

[SPEAKER_03]
No, you didn't overload me.
Yeah, that was all good information.
I don't need it.
I was just curious.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, that's where...
think jeff's concern is he never wants to reach that state either um i certainly don't want to reach that state either like i would like to never be diabetic but yeah the thing is there is a genetic component yes both sides both sides of my family have diabetic history and in extreme senses my uncle died of diabetes and he wasn't he was in college you know like he he just

[SPEAKER_03]
didn't monitor it because he was out of home and not used to not being i think watched over and had a bad night that's how he passed yeah he went to a diabetic coma and died i'd be very sweet i sometimes i don't listen but i hear i know it's like listening and hearing two different things for me it's fine and so then like i heard the last bit and then

[SPEAKER_00]
I have a very mild equivalent where I'll hear a thing and then it takes a little bit for me to process.
And in that time, I've probably asked you to repeat it.

[SPEAKER_03]
But then my brain catches up.
And your brain catches up.
Yeah.
Yeah, I actually, that is ADHD.
And one of the things that was really hard to get the artery process disorders diagnosed is that both...
of them can show the same type of behaviors.
The difference is why.
If I wasn't listening or if I was hearing but not processing because I wasn't slowing down to process, that's ADHD.
If I am hearing but I'm not understanding the words and
But I have the patience, but I don't understand the words.
And then I kind of like work out what those actual words were in my head.
That's the auditory process disorder, which means that both things can be true.
I can both not have the patience to be listening and what I heard was scrambled.
So it gets worse when I'm tired.
So this will be an interesting few hours, shall we?
Yeah.
Good morning.
He gives you a look.
Yeah, actually, he just looks at you and then goes back to his ale.
The compass edge?
Compass's edge?

[SPEAKER_00]
This is what we discussed a little bit.
Is it compasses or compass?
Compass.
Yes, compass.

[SPEAKER_03]
Hello, my name is Marwyn Ashcroft.
This year, my associate is Basgar of the Dakmarnak.
Basgar of the Dakmarnak.
We're of the, we represent a group, the Compass Edge, and, uh, we're interested in exploring one of the Valley Ruins, and we're interested in hiring your services.
We've heard... Not for hired.
You're already occupied?
I didn't say that.
It takes me a little bit to be completely ignoring you.
Is it because our, our objective is too boring?
And he looks at you.
Thanks.
Roll me your insight.
Oh, which one?
One of you has to roll.
Pick one.
Even with the way I've been rolling today?
Even with the way you've been rolling today.
Nine!

[SPEAKER_02]
Never after you roll.

[SPEAKER_03]
I have not rolled above a six today.
I'm going to give you an advantage because you dealt with them, so you can roll one more time.
It's cocked.
Oh, wow.
He doesn't say a thing.
And then he goes back to drink his ale.
I'm not going to say this is a failed encounter.
You can still get him.
But you don't know why he is saying no.
See, I told you.
It's his baby that runs.
You're not exciting.
I mean, you can guess why he has a...
I'm not telling you why he has a problem with the two of you.
Your name's Kargrim Dor, right?
You heard correct.
Why... Why is this your purpose?
You mean taking people up to the mountains?
Yes.
Why do you do it?
I don't want to see people get lose their souls up there.
Dangerous.
So you want to protect people?
You must know yes.
He's getting annoyed at these questions, but he is answering them.
Bhaskar myself and our other associates.
We are brand new to the city.
This is day three for us.
we're going to the valley ruin to learn how to safely explore the ruins before we tackle the bigger ones like the one in the mountain.
If we understand that this will take time and effort for us to learn, that's why we're taking these necessary steps.
That said, we will go on our own without a guide if we must.
And we're not interested
That'd be foolish.
You have all these other dwarves in here.
Pick one of them.
Their only loyalty is going to be to the coin we provide them.
We want somebody more.
Somebody who's going to help be with us as we explore each of the ruined sites.
Someone we can develop a relationship with who will look after us, and we can look after them.
Asgore's going to drop in the dwarven.
We are looking for a friend as much as...
All right, well, what were your persuasion?
One of you.
Okay, I'm happy to do that.
I'm not proficient yet, but I will be.
Second win.

[SPEAKER_00]
Oh, second win.
Is that going to make a difference?

[SPEAKER_03]
You also have Hero of Conspiration.
Oh, I have Hero of Conspiration.

[SPEAKER_00]
Hero of Conspiration.

[SPEAKER_03]
So three.
This is going great, guys.
I will try second wind, because there's no reason not to.

[SPEAKER_00]
So that is 12.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
He's not...
He fumbles, and as you're talking with him, he starts leaving the inn like he's going to say no, but you follow him, you continue to convince him, and then he gives a loud sigh...
No, I don't want to see you get yourself killed.
I'll take you.
But I'm not.
You do.
I only go so far.
You do something so stupid I can't pull you out of.
We will value your advice and experience.
We would not be asking for your help otherwise.
He gives you a dwarven nod.
I mean, when then are we going to take money, some money up front, and then the second half when we return safely.
Minus one third for each person who survived.
Minus, I see.
Spade, are you saying if some of us die, he'll give us a discount?

[SPEAKER_01]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_03]
We can agree to those terms.
Your word?
My word?
He gives you another dwarven bow, which you know as a signal that your word is your bond.
He doesn't say it, but this bow says that.
You know if you break the word, he will.
Oh, yeah.
He's going to hold a grudge.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.
And, Joe, is that part of the 100 gold?
Like, that's where that goes, mostly, is paying him?
Or is that a separate fee?

[SPEAKER_03]
I'll put it in that fee.
Okay.
I'll wrap it all together.
Okay, so we're each subtracting 100 gold now?
No, we're going with the easy route.
The 100 gold was up the hill.
Okay.
You're going down the valley, so it's 50 gold each.
Okay.
So 50 gold for each of us right now.
I think there's an assumption that you'll also use him to go up the mountain.
Correct.
But he didn't bond you to the ward on that.
There's just a...
unspoken assumption that your intent is to build the skill set, which is why he was more willing to be like, okay, you're not being dumb adventurers.
I'll take you to the urn.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm going to wait until one of them pays him and then walk up.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh, did you tell him about... Oh, did you tell him I was also in the party?

[SPEAKER_03]
I did mention our associate.
This urn is Sabriel.

[UNKNOWN]
Oh.

[SPEAKER_03]
Interesting looking fae.
What?
Magical creature, right?
You come from the land of the unicorns?

[SPEAKER_02]
Nearby.

[SPEAKER_03]
They're our healer.
So they will help keep us alive.
Oh.
Good.
Seems, um, that's a lot of, uh...
Okay.
Good.
Good to have a good healer.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm willing to pay my share.

[SPEAKER_03]
All right, he takes it.

[SPEAKER_02]
And I don't get, like, the vibe that he's, like, turned, like, most dwarves, like.

[SPEAKER_03]
He doesn't, you need a perception.
Okay.
Insight.
Insight, yeah.
Yeah, insight.
It's easy.

[SPEAKER_02]
Mm-hmm.

[SPEAKER_03]
20.
He doesn't think you're enough.
He thinks you're a fae.
I mean, ballpark.
We'll explain later.
I'm not entirely wrong.
He's just treating you like a magical woods creature.
He seems a little surprised you have gold.
Like, you have a concept of that as, you know, living with humans.
Like, almost like a...

[SPEAKER_02]
I come to understand this is required.

[SPEAKER_03]
Interesting enough, he's the first person who just assumes you're a fae.
Most people seem to be able to tell you're an elf.
Either he's just a little, that's not really his strong point, or maybe just his interpretation.
He doesn't understand people.
It's just his interpretation.
We need to figure out a class for him.

[SPEAKER_02]
Ranger.

[UNKNOWN]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_03]
When do we leave?
Today.
Immediately, if you're available.
Later today, when you are free.

[SPEAKER_02]
Are there preparations you would recommend?

[SPEAKER_03]
He looks everyone up and down.
Do you all have food, supplies?
Did you spend the money on anything you needed?
I think so, because we were talking about I need to get food and stuff.
We did shopping yesterday, so...

[SPEAKER_02]
I picked up the peppers you wanted.

[SPEAKER_03]
Excellent.
Okay, he takes you all down the mountain.
For getting the share of the bat, getting a dwarf with the interest of learning means that any sort of...
Even if any...
For the ancients, he's basically teaching you how to survive on the eastern mountain ridge, the east-facing ridge of the valley.
Even though that's not where you're going.
So any nature checks on the eastern ridge, even without the dwarf, is going to be easier.
Does that extend to survival as well?
Survival checks?
And on the eastern ridge, yeah.
If you have him, you might be able to forego that check.
It's more like if he's not there, or if he gets injured, or you somehow get him killed, so things like that.
The other part is, unlike the other dwarves, he doesn't really talk about the gold at all.
He seems, he's not of many words, but the words he does say have impact, which is the opposite of gel, so bear with me if I don't do a good job of playing that.
But he has a few words and the words he says are impactful.
But he's not like, illiterate or slow or anything like that.
You travel up the hills into the dense forest and down into the valley.
You start seeing many streams and those streams collect into not quite a river, but a flowing water.
while you go down into the depths of the valley.
To the east, you see the tall, overshadowing, enormous mountains which littered with dwarven caves of old and ruins of old.
And to your understanding, all the way down from the top north peaks all the way down to the southern peaks.
The dwarf is kind enough to explain that the...
I'm trying to remember their names.
Their names is...
The Oath Hold Dwarfs tend to be on the east side of the mountains.
And the...
He doesn't refer to them by their names.
He just begrudgingly calls them their...
Maybe brother, or perhaps cousins.
I think he'll say cousins.
I think when he says cousins, you have enough knowledge of dwarves to know that they think of brothers, but he doesn't want to, he wants to give a little bit more distance than brothers.
And so he refers to them as cousins begrudgingly, that they tend to be on the west side of the mountains, more towards the south.
All right.
You travel with him for two days.
Alongside there, he points to a large cave opening on the face of the mountain.
Not so high in the mountain that it sees snow and ice, but low enough where it is reasonably accessible with a trail winding down the mountain, far off in the distance from down below in the valley.
He points to it and says,
That cave, that entrance there takes you to the eastern side of the mountain where you will find my people.
During this travel, do you have any questions for your Shurka?
When you say the cave goes to your people, do you mean to Dolgorim?
Yes.
How many days travel is Dolgorim from here to this point?
Are you from in Denny Valley?
That's two weeks here.
That's two weeks.
That would be two weeks.
And that's a week.
Two weeks.
And the bird flies.
As the bird flies, given that the bird goes through the tunnel.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_00]
I understand.

[SPEAKER_03]
Unless you're able to somehow go over the mountains, then it is just a week.
But unless you can fly, looking at the Fae, I don't think you're going to be able to go over the mountains.
Yeah, not yet.

[SPEAKER_02]
Given that we're traveling days out, do we want to change direction and take the pony?

[SPEAKER_03]
I think so.
Okay.
If you're game for it, because I don't think you legally are behind, though.
I think you'd want all your stuff, right?
Yeah.
Well, that's the point, by the way.
He doesn't, like, you can just tell he likes it because it's his size, you think?
But he doesn't, like, pamper it or anything.

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh, no, I do enough pampering.

[SPEAKER_03]
You do enough pampering.
It just seems like he's just amused that you have a horse this size.
But he doesn't ever say it.
And if you ask about it, he just grumbles and then leaves.

[SPEAKER_02]
After the
first couple hours traveling with him, I'm probably comfortable enough to also remove that hat.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
Just like all the other dwarves?

[SPEAKER_02]
Yes, not a...

[SPEAKER_03]
Nothing, yeah.
He just, he doesn't even, just a completely different race, no different to how humans look at cows or cows look at pigs.

[SPEAKER_00]
I have a question.
What are the
threats one would expect to encounter in an ancient ruin like this.

[SPEAKER_03]
Sometimes on the other side of the mountains are a lot of spiders, but here I would expect dead.
Sometimes the magic has ways of causing ooze and
got to collect into a living stomach, one would say.
Other times, other adventurers, if they think you're poaching on their turf.

[SPEAKER_02]
Other adventurers will.
They have a good time.

[SPEAKER_03]
What are the sorts of things we might find in the ruins
I hear people like Basgar talk about finds, about recovery.
I'm assuming they mean more than stone.
Magic of power is the primary motivation.
And how do they harness this magic?
Are we talking about scrolls with written word?
Are we talking about talismans?
Or lesser?
Every ancient civilization, every...
He just kind of gestures across all the land.
There's ruins all over the land.
If you see them, you see them.
But they're not always seen.
Sometimes they're buried under the rock.
If you ever visit my people, you will see that it's all throughout these mountains.

[SPEAKER_02]
Did Parkrun practice any distinctly...
Bourbon rituals that would reflect his beliefs at all, I don't know why.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oh, let me answer Christine's question for the magic, and I'll get to that.
They see sometimes the physical items, like sometimes it's nonsensical, like a chair you can never tip over on.
Or sometimes there are items a bit more powerful, like a wand that can be quite destructive.
Other times people repurpose an item, something that is clearly meant to make a campfire, but that energy can be pulled out and repurposed to be a bit more explosive.
I see.
So people take the bits of magic they find and they repurpose them.
Your chair example, somebody maybe could take...
the enchantment from that and put it on a building or a suit of armor or something.
There are rare finds.
And everyone wants a payday.
I feel like you've never been here.
I feel like you have not been here.
But what I can tell you is that everyone is looking for that item that can end
a city where no one has found it.
But some believe the ancients very easily must have that type of technology.
Just have to go deep enough.
I hope it's never found.
And why are you looking for it?
He stops, almost annoyed, like, why am I out here?
I'm not looking for that kind of power.
I'm looking for understanding.
I'm looking to stand in the ancient ruin and listen.
Read the rune.
Read the rune.
You have the ability to read Dwarf.
You want insight.
Insight, yeah.
13 if you at this moment give him your word that that is your purpose you will make him more favorable to you in the dwarven style the vow and everything to signal you that what you're saying you have his word that that is your purpose
I will begin to speak in Dwarven, which I don't think you've heard me do yet before.
So it's not perfect.
We were talking about my pronunciation a little bit.
But I promise I am not looking for the power to destroy or unmake.
I am here to listen, to understand, and learn more about... Why would she phrase it?
And she'd probably stop there and learn more.
And she would do the bow.
He has a satisfied frown and bows to meet your bow.
And yes, I made a note.
Favorable likes due to a willingness to focus on learning and not power.
I'm more interested in the power personally, but... Let me put down... Oh, oh, almost forgot.
I gotta put Chris Jeffs in here.
Yeah.
Just trust orcs.
Eastern orcs.
You figure it out in a few days.
He doesn't think he can trust your word, which basically means he doesn't like you.
Which is also why he wasn't going to go with you.
You know, that's the failed rule, but in two days of traveling, you get the subtleness.
He doesn't...
He's not blunt.
Like, anyone else is rude.
He's not rude about it.

[SPEAKER_00]
He just doesn't
trust me.
He doesn't trust what I'm saying or doing to be authentic.
Because we're not focused on oaths and that stuff.
Well, he is welcome to partake of the food I make.
He is not required to if he doesn't trust.
But I do, on the travel, the first night, I introduce everybody to Gortash, which is a spicy, thick stew, kind of like gumbo.

[SPEAKER_03]
To be clear here, every player can always roll a persuasion to up your likability with someone.
Can you describe to me what you do?
So are you doing anything to improve his likability or are you just like, nah, I don't care?
I think...
I mean, cooking, providing.
Yeah, I think...
Which means you would roll.
You would have to roll.
I think I would be willing to roll.
I think I am going to try and be...

[SPEAKER_00]
Dependable and like sharing open.

[SPEAKER_03]
So you're trying to show the word does matter.
Yeah, I'm trying to show that like Yeah, I'm reliable like I'm reliable what I say I do okay, so I think people you can go for easy super easy just a 5 DC just to like bring him to he trusted your work he doesn't like you but he trusted your work or you can go for 10 and
and basically get a little bit more than that, what he actually does, more than just trust your work, but he does like you, but then it's hard.
If you fail, you don't move anywhere.
Do you want to go with the easy peasy, nice and safe, or do you want to like...

[SPEAKER_00]
This would be a persuasion.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, I want to think of a better stat for it.
I think that makes sense.
And you said the harder one is 10?
10.
I'll do the 10.
Okay.
I mean, you can always be like, hey, I really wanted to make it 15, but I think 10 sucks.

[SPEAKER_00]
I'll start with 10.
If I was proficient in persuasion, I probably wouldn't do that.
Holy crap.
Okay.
Well, I don't need to second wind this.
That is a 19.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah.
Okay.
So he trusted your word.
We're starting to get an understanding.
Your word is of value.
And everything with...
With these dwarves, everything about them, unlike their counterparts, it's all a matter of how much they trust your word.
Everything comes down to your word.
I would say in two days, you don't use contract language around them.
I would say in two days, you probably would have learned that they associated...
If you have to make an agreement with writing, it goes against everything they stand for.
If you have to have that, that means your word means nothing.

[SPEAKER_00]
I think that's where Bazgar starts to open, start making that connection because the start of things, thinking about contracts, the little bit of do we need to sign a contract kind of stuff, Bazgar hates all that.
He will not sign a contract.

[UNKNOWN]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
I do want to attempt to gradually improve my relationship as well, probably through whatever I learned based on, like, does he have any rituals or beliefs that he follows?

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah.
Oh, you don't have to follow.
I think to figure out what that is is combined with becoming more likable with him.
So if you succeed, he will be friendlier with you.
He'll trust your words.
And you'll learn more about his religion and their beliefs.
But if you fail, you won't.

[SPEAKER_02]
Okay, so the persuasion check to see how kind of that develops?

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, because you would only get that information if you can draw a connection with him.
Okay.
Just like before, you can choose your own difficulty.
And it's all or nothing, so you can't roll progressively.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm going to try 10 as well.
Okay.
Okay, so that is a...
Six plus four, so ten.

[SPEAKER_03]
Wow.
Just right on the limit.
Well done.
They literally believe that they came from stone.
As in, they are stone.
And when they die, they will become stone again.
In the literal sense.
It's unclear if that's real.
Like, if real real?
Like, because you've never seen a dwarf turn to stone.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, it means I'm not kicking any rocks currently.

[SPEAKER_03]
But the thing is, do you question that logic?

[SPEAKER_02]
I would love to have a strike.
I know he's not a very conversational person, especially during the day travel.
But I think since I go figure don't sleep most of the time, I think in the wee hours of the night around the campfire, I'd like to strike up that conversation of,
Is there, like, a deity of stone, or, like, how...
I understand you come from stone.
How did you... How did your people become?

[SPEAKER_03]
Doesn't...
Here.
Yeah, like, some believe there are...
He's a deeper voice, sorry.
Some believe there are...
A creator who crafted us from the stone.
But he's not here anymore.

[SPEAKER_02]
Like most gods, gone.

[SPEAKER_03]
Our clerics, they draw their power from a variety of deities.
We don't believe any of those deities are the original ones who crafted the clay.

[SPEAKER_02]
Do you have your own clerics who draw power from the crafter?

[SPEAKER_03]
Yes, just like elves.
If you met one.

[SPEAKER_02]
I've met a few of them.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oh.
They're very delicate folks.
Emotional.
He had no idea.
If you don't tell him, he had no idea.
He really beats you up from the woods at a cafe.
It is best for you.
You stay in the woods.
It's much more relaxing out.

[SPEAKER_02]
Traveling is very interesting.
Why, if I may ask, why do most dwarves have a disregard for the open kind?

[SPEAKER_03]
Most dwarves have a disregard.
What do you mean by disregard?

[SPEAKER_02]
An unfavorability.
Unfavorability.
For preference, yeah.
Why, what is the, is there an origin for this?
Disinterest or dislike?

[SPEAKER_03]
I mean, are you talking about elves just generally being grotesque?

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh, it's an aesthetic choice.

[SPEAKER_03]
Mostly, yes.

[SPEAKER_02]
It wasn't an event or a confrontation.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oh, I mean, are you talking about how they generally stuck up?

[SPEAKER_02]
That's more of a personality preference.

[SPEAKER_03]
Thinks that they were the ancients?

[SPEAKER_02]
Don't most species think they were the ancients?
Except for dwarves?

[SPEAKER_03]
I mean, dwarves think they were the ancients too, but that's because who else would have known their entire civilization?
I'm starting to think humans, actually.
No offense, but... No, dear.
Humans would be my second choice.

[SPEAKER_02]
I actually think ancients may have been made up of all of them.

[SPEAKER_03]
That is a very unique perspective, I would say.
But...
All the races haven't learned to work together in the last few ages.
What makes you think that they had it all figured out before they blew themselves up?

[SPEAKER_02]
I don't think they did.

[SPEAKER_03]
They're not here anymore.
What were you asking?
You were talking about something.
So you kind of get from him that
It's not one thing.
They don't like how they look.

[SPEAKER_02]
There's just conflicts of interest, but it wasn't perpetuated by an event.
They don't like the way you look.

[SPEAKER_03]
They don't like the way you act.

[SPEAKER_00]
There's just so many cultural disconnects that bang against each other.

[SPEAKER_02]
And that's fine.
I'm trying to uncover history that I may not have been informed of.

[SPEAKER_03]
But do you really kind of...
I would say he doesn't, I know the conversation happened very quickly here, because he has a few words and a few dates.
You get this all throughout the whole series of many little conversations.
Yeah.
And you, like, every step of the way is a clash.
Dwarves don't really, they don't worship a deity in the same level.
They have many different deities.
None of them have really temples.
They're very... You don't?
I'll get back to that.
Let me get through my whole description.
They don't have, like, dedicated temples in the same way that elves or even humans do.
They don't have, um...
The women have beards.
They, they're, they, they, they do...
I'll put it this way.
Like, they're bee-sized across the board.
Like, elves are skinny.
They don't have, um...
What is the other things?
Even the food, the diet, the cuisine, every culturally different thing across the checkbox is just a direct opposition.
Opposition.
A dwarf would be miserable living with elves.
An elf would be miserable living with a dwarf.
And that's kind of what he says.
Elves are totally welcome in our caves.
They would just be very unhappy.

[SPEAKER_02]
They would be.
They need the open skies.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oh, you do get... Their entire society lives in the mountains.
They do not have any surface cities whatsoever.
Which is even contradictory.
That is even... You get that that is even different than the southern dwarves.
The southern dwarves live not...
They use the... Oh yeah, he will get angry at this.
The one time he does get conversational.
The southern dwarves, they want to live...
out, they want to use their cave systems to mine the earth.
And they filled it up with contract workers to pull all the valuable goods out of there.
And there's no room for them to be part of the earth.
They're just there to be, to pull the resources out and sell it to humans and elves and all the other races.
They are my cousin.
We live in the earth.
We live with the ground.
We don't sell our resources to other nations.
Not like that.
That is the most you get.

[SPEAKER_02]
That's probably the moment where we can kind of reach that sort of understanding between each other.

[SPEAKER_00]
It is true.
I have seen the Garhamara and they're very different.

[SPEAKER_03]
And you were asking about...
Yes.
You do give us about the religion.
They don't...
They have...
At most shrines, they don't build huge temples, and that's because they don't want the different groups.
It's more like a personal choice.
And so they don't build temples because that would hint that that's a government choice, and the government is against picking a deity.
The government is about the stone, about the earth.
So in their mind, they live in a temple.
That temple is the mountain.
building another temple inside of their temple is a bit... Would be weird.

[SPEAKER_02]
Weird.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, that'd be like going into a church and doing a Hamas.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
Right?

[SPEAKER_03]
Like, what are you doing?

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.
I think in the early days when he and I are kind of initially at odds, I think what kind of probably changes that is
is Bazgar actually confronts him on it.
Okay.
And actually has that conversation about... Because to Baz, the dismissal...

[SPEAKER_03]
I know he's not super rude about it or anything, so Baz is not aggressive about it, but the dismissal of his honor as... Because the oaths matter less than the perception of honor in this case.
It's not the same thing.
It's not...

[SPEAKER_00]
It's not that he has to prove that he will keep his word.
It's that the idea that he won't because he's an orc offends him.
And so they have that kind of like hash out and probably over food where Bazgar is clearly holding in like... You're getting into a little fight with him.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, I think there's a small fight.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah, sure, they fight.
Yeah, I think there's a small fight.

[SPEAKER_03]
They go back and forth.
You figure it out.
That's how you improve your likability with him, is that it was an honest fight.
And, yeah.
Yeah.
He doesn't hold any grudges.
We're going to get to the place we're going.
Excellent.
Go ahead.
One more thing.
Yeah.
So, first night, when we're outside of town, we camp.
Later in the night, Marwyn will get a little bit of distance from the camp.
And I would at least like to look over the scroll that I turned a man into goo.
Okay.
I'm not trying to cast it, just trying to see if I can even understand it.
Well, you're Arcana.
It is a dirty 20.
it is not a spell having anything to do with booze, and you know that whoever used it did not use it at all correctly.
You also know, to put it in out-of-character terms, it is clearly not a level 1 spell.
Whatever it is, not level 1.
And it is a spell of some sort, but not level 1.
I can't kind of figure out in general what power scale it would be or what its actual intention is, what it would do.
You know it is designed to murder.
Like, it's a weapon of some sort.
Okay, it's a weapon scroll of some kind.
No, I did not give you a scroll, Meteorite.

[SPEAKER_00]
No.

[SPEAKER_03]
But it is on that direction of, like, this is not...
It's some kind of powerful, destructive spell.
Yeah.
Okay.
Interesting.
But it is not probably higher than level four or five.
It's up there.
Solid, like strong, way out of our league spell.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
And the harder part is that because it's written in ancient, and ancient writing for spells is not something that is taught.
Like even if you know ancient, ancient spells are another level of difficulty.
Yeah.
That makes sense.
I will then quietly roll it back up, put it away, separate from the scroll of sleep I always have in my person.
Don't mix those up.
Yep, don't mix those up in a combat situation, and we will come back to this later when I have more knowledge.
And just like with the tower, with the tower, you get to a...
It just suddenly arrives out of nowhere, just because the forest is just a little too dense, but the dwarf knows his way.
And an opening, what looks like an opening in the ground that is just a crack, doesn't look like any ruins, appears.
And the dwarf points to the opening, and you find the ruins just below the cavern here.

[SPEAKER_00]
Shall I go first?

[SPEAKER_02]
Logistically, Kargumdar...
Do you explore the ruins with us, or do you just remain for when we return?

[SPEAKER_03]
What would you like?
You could wash the pony.

[SPEAKER_02]
That's what I was thinking.
Wouldn't mind if you would stay with Lear and make sure.

[SPEAKER_03]
I would love to keep your pony company.

[SPEAKER_02]
Gives you a bag of apples.

[SPEAKER_03]
Gives you a bag of apples.
He takes the pony off to one side and sits down by the stream.
that runs adjacent to the opening and has a quiet meditative time with your pony who sits or is standing next to the dwarf and appreciating the joys of the wilderness.
Something that you would never see from a Garhammer dwarf.

[SPEAKER_02]
I do briefly say goodbye to Lear in case this is a more dangerous party than I expect.
So I think that's a sort of like ritual goodbye where like, you know, you put your forehead up against the horse's head.
Okay.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
You're so sweet.
I look up at the crow.
I go, are you coming with?
She's talking to the bird.
She's talking to the bird.
And then I will turn to go into the tunnel.
Lower your perception, Jeff or Nicole.
Oh, if you're paying attention, you don't need to roll.

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh, I'm saying goodbye to my pony.
I'm probably not paying attention.

[SPEAKER_03]
You got this, Jeff.
Natural 20.

[SPEAKER_02]
Why?

[SPEAKER_03]
You're paranoid about this bird.
The bird, since you've already told Christine, the bird, as soon as she turns away, the bird does another human-like roll of the eyes in a bird form.
Very noticeable and, to give you a natural 20, exactly...
In alignment, the moment she looks away.
Like, you had your doubt before.
You have no doubt that that bird understands what she is saying.
And after a solid roll of the birds, it's not quite like the eyes.
It's almost like a little head roll.
Yeah, right.
Because the eyes are too small.
It flies down to...
He lands on your head.
On the shoulder.
Okay.
It's a little dignified here.
Well, you're persuaded.

[SPEAKER_00]
Everybody has very different interactions with their animals.
Four.

[SPEAKER_03]
The bird chops up back on your head.
After you struggle with it, how do you tend with it?
Do you accept that the bird is just going to sit on your head or are you going to exist?
Here's Mara's compromise.
She'll take the bird off a second time, put up her hood, and then let the bird do what it's going to do.
It is very... At least that way I'm not getting a little talent to feed in my hair.
It is very, like...
It looks silly.

[SPEAKER_02]
The hair that I've been treating for split ends as well, so... Yeah.

[UNKNOWN]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
It's quite a large bird, so... Can't be comfortable.
Yeah, I would say...
The bird after a while does move to your shoulders.
Okay.
He hops around.
He or she is very restless in one spot, so...
But going into the cave, the bird does not have much of an option but to be on somebody's shoulders.
But you...
I would say the bird's restlessness is really like it sits on your head, it gets restless, it then hops down to your shoulder, it gets restless, and then hops back on you.

[SPEAKER_00]
I do not think they have anything dangerous enough around here.

[SPEAKER_02]
Must have something worthy.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yes, he's got his chest a bit puffed out.

[SPEAKER_03]
The crack opens up to...
the ruins into the solid stonework of the ancients, and the light dims to entire darkness.
Yeah, lights.
I have ridiculously long darkvision.
Two of the three party members can currently see in the dark.
So for me, I'm going to cast Produce Flame, which will begin to emanate light.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm gonna turn it yellow.

[SPEAKER_03]
Red!
I command it and it turns back to red.

[SPEAKER_02]
Blue.

[SPEAKER_03]
Red.
The bird does, I think, when you get more into the tunnel, it probably hops off and just hopping, it's just kind of hopping behind the party because of, like, so, like, with the head, if your head bobs at all, the bird has to reposition.
Yeah.
The shoulder of the bird is just a little too big to be comfortable on the shoulder.
So you're kind of happy that the bird decides that it doesn't need to use your head for an area.
But it's not really an idea.
So the bird is just pop, pop, pop, pop.
I don't know what's wrong with this thing today.

[SPEAKER_02]
I am going to come up behind Marvin and...
I don't know if I have to roll for this.
I'd like to touch the crow.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
And cast light on it.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
Now you have a crow that's lit.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
Let's just solve your problem.
Cool.

[SPEAKER_03]
Now I have two light sources.
There you go.
I don't know.
That's kind of like a crow god at this point with a light like silhouetting it.

[SPEAKER_02]
Mm-hmm.
It's like a white silvery light, too.
Oh, nice.
It's like very majestic.

[SPEAKER_00]
What are you doing?
I think I will take point.
I will move.
We will move slowly, quietly, and I will be a little ahead.
So if I encounter danger, I will be hopefully not blunder into it.
I will hopefully see it first, or at least it won't see me.

[SPEAKER_02]
Are these the types of caves where we can generally travel side by side or should we have a single file order?

[SPEAKER_03]
At first it's a single file, but once you get into the ancient territory, it starts becoming more reasonable to navigate.
You see twisting hallways and broken stairwells that go back and forth between ancient ruins and corridors to cave-like structures.

[SPEAKER_00]
shattered beneath the earth i have a question does the the ancient structures like you said that it goes into caves does it look like the ancient structures built like the staircase goes into a cave like deliberately or does it look like they got like buried into the caves or something buried okay so it doesn't look like they took existing caves and built into them it looks like they've gotten
mashed together somehow.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, this looks like this used to be an entire, like, used to not, used to be above ground.
Okay.
As you're going through, you start seeing just a maze of tunnels.
You could easily get lost down here.
The only saving grace you have is you're like, oh, hey, I know how to get back out, is because there's just a general trajectory of going down
And so, you know, like, okay, if we need to get out, we got to head up.

[SPEAKER_02]
We also have the glowing thing.
So if we come to a very complicated intersection, we can plan our way back.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
The glow ink.

[SPEAKER_03]
Are you using it?
It'd be very wise.
If we have any tricky turns or anything.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.
That's why we bought it is for this.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
Navigating backwards.
I think the three of us aren't naturally disposed to navigating or anything like that.

[SPEAKER_00]
No, we're not.
No.
So, having an aide is very helpful.

[SPEAKER_02]
Remind me to think back on...

[SPEAKER_03]
The tunnel.
Some cartographer's tools.
As you go down, use... Out of this way.
A...
While one entrance...
comes into the right side of your view of what's down.
And it looks...
It's of notable interest, as it just doesn't seem like it matches a lot of the other ancient territory or ancient ruins.
It looks like it was added after the fact.
Like the door was?
Like...
Yeah, the opening.
It doesn't look... You can know the difference between ancient and modified ancient.
This looks like it was modified.
Okay.
Joe, I need to send you a question.
Sure.

[SPEAKER_00]
I am going to be going first, like I said, and I'm going to try and move stealthily.

[SPEAKER_03]
Do you go into the modified entrance?

[SPEAKER_00]
I...
there aren't other options other options okay but this one is it's um i would say the other options seem like the more the same okay um my my first thought is that it is um modified it is people of the now times did this which may mean likely it is already already explored
But at least it's different.

[SPEAKER_02]
Is this modified for like a smaller creature or about a medium-sized creature?
Or in a way that we would understand as like cohesive construction or just like modified as in like broken apart?

[SPEAKER_03]
I'm distracted.

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh yeah, no, that's fair.
I'm just saying I think we need more assessment details.
My initial thought was as a
Within the mountain, it could just be kobolds.

[SPEAKER_00]
Right.
Who, yeah.
I was just thinking when you started talking, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
It made me think of that, too.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oops, one.
I'm going to type up an N when I'm at the...
There you go.
I don't want...
If they see me doing a brand-new Nazi, I don't want her to read it.
You used the wrong your.
I know, I know.
It's fine.

[SPEAKER_01]
Thank you.

[SPEAKER_03]
Sorry, Nicole had a question.
Yeah, we had a question.
I used your...
I did use your, okay.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_00]
uh the shit the way the doorway is like been modified does it look like what we'd see in art and forward where it's like human modified or does it look like maybe hands that are not human i'll make it hard was that an investigation investigation yeah yeah it's probably investigation um
I'd love it if you did it, but I think because I asked...
I'm distracted.

[SPEAKER_03]
I'm doing something else right now.

[SPEAKER_02]
So perception should be me.
Investigation should probably be you.

[SPEAKER_03]
Because I think you have a moment where Marwen has closed her eyes.
It just seems to be... Are you meditating for a minute?

[SPEAKER_00]
No.

[SPEAKER_03]
And even with... Yeah, it's made from human.
Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]
It doesn't look any different than above me.

[SPEAKER_03]
But it is different from everything around.
It is noticeable.

[SPEAKER_00]
I worry...
I don't know why adventurers would have modified this, but I worry it's been explored.
But it's a starting point.
We go this way.
Yes?

[SPEAKER_02]
I agree, Buster.

[SPEAKER_03]
You start coming in, and it's a long, winding corridor.
And at the very end, you see a light going down one tunnel.
Dim.
In darkness, it's a split.
In darkness, going down the other.
A light.
On their adventures, perhaps?

[SPEAKER_01]
Want me to find out?

[SPEAKER_02]
Mm-hmm.
From, like, I don't think 60 feet's really long enough to see much, so I don't think I could pick one or the other other than there's a light going on.

[SPEAKER_00]
Well, I'm going to see if I can get closer and figure out what the light is.
Again, stealthy.

[SPEAKER_03]
Light often means magic.
Trust me.
That could be good.
Not exclusively, but, you know, it's a good sign, I'd say.
Do you want to lower yourself, Jack?
Sure.
Maybe his glowing sword.
Here's a ferret.
Just in case.
Pretty fetter.
Do better.
Oh, I will do better.

[SPEAKER_00]
Uh, that is 17.
Okay.

[SPEAKER_03]
You, as you go down the tunnel, you see that it opens up to a chamber at the end.
You can't see much into the chamber than entering the chamber, but it is a chamber of some sorts.
There's a coziness about it.
You can't quite put your finger on why it feels cozy.
Maybe it reminds you of old time of a campfire, where it just feels warm.

[SPEAKER_00]
I'm going to wave my party up and then take a cautious step inside and see what is in here.

[SPEAKER_03]
You come to a quite large round room that has a marinae, marinae, what is that over there in the assortment?

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah, like a menagerie.

[SPEAKER_03]
A menagerie of herbs and potions and tables and pots of all sorts, but scattered and disorganized.

[SPEAKER_00]
This is not what I expected.
Holy crap, Marwan, were you right?
Is this magic?
The potions and stuff.

[SPEAKER_03]
I'm going to take a look around at their setup, try to figure out maybe, like, is this just a generic wizard's kind of workshop or an herbalist, or try to get a sense for who this might belong to and maybe what they were making.
Okay, let me get an inspection.
Would this be investigation or arcana?
Or nature?
What are you trying to find?
I'd like to figure out what kind of practitioner this setup might belong to.
Be it a wizard, a witch, an herbalist, etc.
Yeah, go ahead and roll.
What skill?
Arcana.
Gone forever.
Good catch, though.
Only at 11.

[SPEAKER_02]
Do you also want to... Next time, ask for a do-better.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, sorry.
I'm not rolling great today, guys.
Most of my rolls have been to six or less.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's the way it goes sometimes.
Yeah, we want you to have your moment, though.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
You're not close enough for me to smack you like a hand jab.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah.
You're fine.
Oh, you're looking...
In this order.
Um... A... Ah, my foot.
I just...
I can't feel it.
It's such a weird feeling.
Come on.
Come on.
Wake up.
I can't move my toes.
This was a very powerful magical effect.
Okay, tingling.
Coming back.
There you go.
You find a spire archive of dozens of small items arranged in an ideological order of keys, teeth, buttons, coins, ring fragments, broken holy symbols.
Some are tagged with neat common labels, others have frantic labeling with stout mid-word written almost in a scrabble rather than with
by a elegant hand.
What are some of the things labeled?
I feel like there's a rule.
Because I will say, you've listed off several things that are literally in my bag.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
Do you have broken holy symbols in your bag?

[SPEAKER_03]
No, not that yet.
You have a pretty...
The labels are not complete enough for you to put two and two together.
This is exactly what this is, but yeah.
These are ingredients a witch would have.
You know this.
These are witches' materials.
I was afraid of that.
You find the ink...
You find an ink robe.
Ink what?
Groove.
Ink groove.
Okay.
Shallow ritual groove in stained black with years of correcting.
Basically, it's like a plate which you can put ink on.
Yeah.
For actual writing.
Are there any...
There's no notebooks here or spell books or anything.
I guess the labels, I couldn't even read that writing, so it wouldn't do me much good.
A mirror that isn't for vanity.
Cracked hand.
Popped up her face to face the inside of the cave.
You see the letters M-A-R-A M-A-R-A
Yes, written in many different handwritings.
Fine.
Bone chimes.
Rolls of ash, dried berries, and rusted knives, and cracked teacups.
Looking at things like the berries and stuff, are these fresh?
There's signs that somebody was here recently.
It's an investigation, Shaq.
Hard.
Can I have a do better?

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah, you can have a do better.

[SPEAKER_03]
Of course, now following my streak is ending.
That'd be a 24.
You find a teacup that is still warm.
Here's the other important thing.
I know of one other person who may have come to these ruins at some point.
Is there anything here that reminds me of Claire?
Or is this somebody unrelated?
I think it's fair to say, you know, it's a witch of some sort.
You can...
I guess that's history of your people.
I think that's a history check for your own people.
I think I would know if it was my own sister's setup.
Doesn't sound like her, but I'm just double-checking.
It's not her.
Okay.
That's why it would be a history check, because it's not her.
Let's see if I might know who it was.
They don't talk too much about these cases.
Okay, that's what I'm afraid of, Jo.

[SPEAKER_02]
Do you want to do better?

[SPEAKER_03]
This is...
I have a hard check.
I don't think...
So, Marwyn asked when she started looking around before.
This wouldn't be something you'd ask for.
I don't think so.
I think now you're starting to see her...
What's happened over the course of the last, like, minute is her looking around at the setup.
You can see recognition, putting two and two together, quickly, like, looking at labels, looking around, like, trying to see if she's missing something.

[SPEAKER_02]
You're processing.
She's processing very quickly.
I'm just going to give you a do better.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay.
I think as, like, to start with, Asgard makes a joke about how we found Marwyn's house.
And then as Marwyn's getting more and more, like, into it.

[SPEAKER_03]
You know that this is not that witchy.
And on cue, you hear the sound of something crawling down the tunnel that you came from, the only way you know how to get out.
It sounds like a thousand little legs chattering against the rock surface.
Is there any other exits from this room?

[SPEAKER_01]
That's the only one, right?

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah.
Now there is a fork down the tunnel, however, you would have to go head towards the oncoming.
I look to the crow and I tell it, go, warn her.
The crow hops back and forth looking down the tunnel, then looks at you.
I'm a crow flapping its wings like you're an idiot.
Then wait for your moment.
Ready yourselves.

[SPEAKER_00]
Bam!
Bangs the axe against the shield.
Let's do this.
Um... Oh, gosh.

[SPEAKER_03]
Well, time to die at level two.

[SPEAKER_02]
There's not a door in this, uh, in this cozier area.
Is there, like, was it modified to have a door?
The opening's wide open, yeah.
I'm an othometer, Jean Slabichuk.

[SPEAKER_00]
No, that's wide open.

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh, wide open.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
So, down...
The cold are you here?
I see I have guests.
I'm going to pull out that rib bone I recovered two days ago.
Out of the words, bone set close, shadow drawn, I carry weight until the dawn.
And I'm going to press the bone up against my collarbone.
And you guys will see almost like shadow wrap around Morrowind for a moment.
Before it disappears from sight, I'm going to cast Mage Armor.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm going to cast Bless on the two of you and me.

[SPEAKER_03]
And through the opening...
We're not combat yet.
Oh, dang it.
It's okay.
We're ready.
We're just preparing.

[SPEAKER_00]
I'm preparing.

[SPEAKER_03]
You're preparing for combat.
You see a human head at first coming into view into the light.
And then a moment later, an entire centipede body is attached to this head at the front about the size of maybe two to three humans in length.

[SPEAKER_02]
It's a terrible movie reference, but okay.
What?
The human centipede.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oh, no, nothing like that.
It winds back and forth as its little legs carry the back of its body.
The upper front of the centipede is longer than normal.
Perhaps they were once arms of some sort, but they seem to be a little bit more dexterous than the rest of her tiny little legs.

[SPEAKER_02]
Is this a monster?

[SPEAKER_00]
Well, I did not expect this.

[SPEAKER_03]
Now, I guess we have guests.
Would you like tea?
As she enters the room, this monstrous creature.
Do you really?

[SPEAKER_02]
I mean, what kind of tea?

[SPEAKER_03]
Do you ask?

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
I'm going to sniff.
What's the...
The...

[SPEAKER_03]
The...
The centipede creature head gets right up close to yours, creepily close, and says, Jasmine.
Delicious.
And she gets too working to making Jasmine.
I'm gonna go ahead and, uh, Marwyn's very wide-eyed during this, and when she turns to start making tea, I'm gonna start, like, very carefully.
Maneuver my way towards the door.
I'm going to come up and let you guys start trying to move.
See, she gets to the door, and by the crow's also hopping.
Yep.
You can read the crow's scare, too.
Oh, yeah.
She immediately whips around, gets up close to you.
Am I not your sister?
You don't like us?
We were once.
Once.
I didn't mean to intrude uninvited, sister.
Then sit, sister.
Sit.
I insist.
She takes her many little legs and ushers you over to a broken chair that you can't even sit on, like if it was still a chair.
Maybe one cup of tea, but then we must be going.
We will make you one cup of tea.
I will make you one cup of tea.
Or perhaps we will make you a cup of tea, but either way you will have a cup of tea.
She then turns away from you and starts making you a cup of tea.
So while I'm standing over there, I'm going to see, does the crow continue to make its way out?
Crow's petrified.
Crow's not sure how to proceed.
If you want to try to get the crow to leave, you might need to persuade, but the thing about the crow is a crow has to hop.
And right now, the crow does not want to make any noise.
So he is not hopping.
He is petrified, trying, like he doesn't have the sky.

[SPEAKER_00]
Is this a friend of yours?

[SPEAKER_03]
I'm going to say in Dwarven Neo, we're in trouble.
Well, I don't understand that, unfortunately.
I am Mara.
Mara makes tea.
We are Mara.
Mara makes tea.
Or am I?
I am Mara.
I am Mara.
I am Mara.
I am Mara.
I am Mara.
Making tea.
I need to find my other advice here.

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh, I'm going to offer red bean pastries since I carry those with me.

[SPEAKER_03]
She takes them.

[SPEAKER_02]
It's part of the tea.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oh, so delicious.
And she serves you all jasmine tea.
You are, if it's not clear, you are extremely uncomfortable by the situation in her grotesque body things about jasmine.
a fourth, and probably less about a fifth of the entire room.
And it just sort of twined, like the little legs that governs her body seems to have a line of its own from the upper part of her body that twists and turns and looks one way than the other.

[SPEAKER_00]
I am not going to put my shield away.
I'll shoot the axe, I'll put it in the belt loop, and I'll use the shield as like a table.
I'm not taking the shield off.
I don't mind that skillet very quickly.

[SPEAKER_03]
It's just tea is an even look edible at this point.

[SPEAKER_02]
She makes jasmine tea.
I did this for a reason ago.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah.
You're drinking it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tastes fine.
So you'll see Marwyn is going to go ahead and drink the tea as well.
Yeah.
It's that thing of never taking your eyes off of Mara.
here i'm going to drink the tea it's very much one of those things like sip sip drain we really must be going sister she doesn't even hear you she goes back in the mirror and she starts like fixing her hair that's connected to her face and she's like i am more i'm still more i'm gonna start trying to creep towards the door and more will yourself check knocks back the tea

[SPEAKER_02]
In a soft voice, Sabriel is going to offer to do Mara's hair for them.
Wow, these two are retreating.

[SPEAKER_03]
Sure.
Well, me... No, she'll just let you do it.
I got a dirty 20 on my stealth check.
Yeah, you're stealthing away.
And I want to scoop up the crow.
Scoop up the crow.
The crow's eye is wide open.
You can tell the crow's just in a... You're in caves.
The crow's just as fucked as you right now.

[SPEAKER_00]
Basgar's torn because Marwyn's sneaking out, but...
I guess I will also sneak out with the distraction.
lot of looks over the shoulder towards uh sabriel and apparently that's going to be a problem how do you bring her attention to you do you fall do you crack do you yeah i think um he's like he's making his way out he the the distraction but like he's worried about sabriel and i think uh he bumps up against like one of the like tables counters or whatever and knocks one of the um because it sounds like there's like teacups and stuff scattered around

[SPEAKER_03]
knocks a teacup on the floor and shatters it.
So the cup shatters.
And before you turn, Mara's face, she looks at you and it completely changes.
Young lady, you need to go.
She says, well,
restraining something deeper in her.
In fact, I would say she even, a tear drops from her eye.

[SPEAKER_02]
When a nod is an understanding, turn is like scoop, like try to carry back, like the link hands grab Bazgar and start heading out.

[SPEAKER_03]
As soon as we're in the tunnel, I would say, we're running like it's a horror movie.
That's the game plan.

[SPEAKER_02]
I mean,

[SPEAKER_00]
My initiative streak has ended.
It's not the worst, but it's nowhere near where it has been.

[SPEAKER_02]
Okay, so I'm for Sabriel.

[SPEAKER_00]
Somebody's world, right?

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay, well, actually, I really need to print this out.
It's okay.
Actually, I need a couple minutes in this hurry.

[UNKNOWN]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
Creepy spider.
Creepy centipede lady.
Creepy centipede lady.

[SPEAKER_02]
Sabriel is not often phased by beings of higher power.
Let me put it that way.

[SPEAKER_00]
No, no.

[SPEAKER_02]
I think they felt very uncomfortable internally could react to the situation, but externally they have a lot of...

[SPEAKER_03]
practice the calm facade pretty easy comes up pretty easily they're also I think Joe and I have talked about this before they tend to be somewhat braver than most elves of the contemporaries so well everything you did would have pacified her to some degree because you're basically obviously there's some humanity in there so you're speaking to that human side yeah otherwise she wouldn't have warned you she would have eaten you

[SPEAKER_02]
Yep.
That is the risk, always.

[SPEAKER_03]
I really like how you took it, by the way.
I like that.
It gave it for a very interesting dynamic, because it kind of outlined that she is more than just a monster, but she is a centipede monster.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, I think there was that compassionate side where
They saw the attempt at preserving whatever human was left there and was trying to...

[SPEAKER_03]
When she looked at you, you could very easily tell that whatever humanity is left in her is in pain.
Yeah.
Stuck.

[SPEAKER_00]
She has been trapped in the body of the monster.

[SPEAKER_02]
I think Christine might also be using the restroom.
I'm not sure.

[SPEAKER_03]
I'm going to go to my bathroom.

[UNKNOWN]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]
Poor monster witch.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
I don't know if we're going to put her on the power scale, unfortunately.
I'm reacting to how Marwyn's reacting, but this might be very difficult.

[SPEAKER_00]
No idea if this is a winnable fight.
Bazgard's going to try.
If it looks like we're going to lose, Bazgard is not above retreating, but if it seems winnable, he's going to try and win it.

[SPEAKER_02]
I think you and I should try to...
Keep it from reaching Marwen.

[SPEAKER_00]
My goal is to get in that doorframe, that doorway, with Marwen in the hallway.

[SPEAKER_02]
Or even have it come into the hall.
That way it's more constrained.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
I mean, it's centipede.
It could probably walk up the ceiling, though, so...

[SPEAKER_00]
It does depend on how high the ceiling is, but yes.
Yeah.
But yeah, my goal is to at all times be between Marwen and it.
Preferably between both of you and it, but... Well...
I'll probably be middle range.
At the moment, you're on kind of the wrong side of the room.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, you and I are side by side right now because I was able to retreat.
Oh, yeah.
And kind of, yeah, retreat with you.
Look for a tunnel or an underground thing there.
We will train Joe to use the maps.
In spite of his best efforts.

[SPEAKER_00]
There's a couple potentials.
Doesn't really look like there's a half cave, half ruin.

[SPEAKER_02]
I think even just a one page side should be fine.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.
But there are some cavey things that we could use and I think they'd be fine.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah, I think that would make sense.

[SPEAKER_00]
There's even this nice little, like... That could be a suit of armor.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
Centipede creature?

[SPEAKER_00]
At the table.
We could fight it.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
Want to get our people?
You and me.
Here.
I don't know what I'm at.
Okay.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, I might need something a little bit more custom.
Have it back.
I will give you guys a grade.

[SPEAKER_00]
Wow, Bazgar is smart enough to know.

[SPEAKER_02]
Hey, we now have an encounter that ties into Morrowind.
Yeah?
It's pretty.

[SPEAKER_00]
Well, Bazgar knows enough about lots and lots of places, you know, knocking something like that prone is not easy.
So, we're going to go Warhammer.

[UNKNOWN]
You're having some trouble, Joe.

[SPEAKER_03]
You're having some trouble there, Joe.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah, I know.
Alright, finish up this thing so we can throw the bag away, Jeff.

[SPEAKER_00]
Oh, yep.

[SPEAKER_01]
We can do that.

[SPEAKER_02]
There's only gonna be one good one left.

[SPEAKER_03]
I'm sorry I got you all killed at level two.
It was a good game.
What?
You're playing away.

[SPEAKER_00]
I'm not.

[SPEAKER_03]
You're not?
No, no.
Maybe we should be.

[SPEAKER_00]
No, no.

[SPEAKER_03]
I like it.
I like it.
I can deal with this.
Thanks for the warning.
I don't want to kill you.
I don't know what we're doing here.
I'm in trouble by it.
We need a board.
Jeff, could you pick up your stuff real quick?
The glass radius is 30 feet.
Can I see it so I can measure things at that scale?
Sure.
Oh, she's got one too.
Oh, perfect.
Is this exactly 30 feet?
Is it 30 or is it 25 radius?
It should be 30.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay, so that's 30.
Yeah, I think the smaller, the second ring is probably the 20.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oh, okay.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah, that should be a 30 foot.

[SPEAKER_03]
It does say here 20 foot, yeah.
So this is the chamber.

[SPEAKER_00]
I'm pretty sure it's a fireball dimension.
Oh, maybe it is a fireball.
That might be a 20-foot one.

[SPEAKER_03]
30.
30.
NASCAR, please run behind me.
I made no promises.
I'm down here.
Okay.
And this is the offshoot tunnel I talked about before.
And then this is just a long...
tunnel almost except joey planned for a creepy runaway scene okay and so you can put your characters here so where where are we starting off i know i i was in the lead am i at the mouth here or am i further in the area here because you just got to the door you can put the crow the crow is a character here yeah the crow may be the most important character here yeah um oh yeah
Actually, Flicker is with you, Jeff.
So where are they in the chamber?
I'm going to leave this out there just so I can have something nice and angry.
Where are they?
We're between you and... You were there with the... Yeah, I was in the lead.
In the mirror.
Flicker's on you.
Whatever that's worth.
So here's how we're going to do.
You get a...
I'm going to give a surprise round to you.
To represent her telling you to run.

[SPEAKER_01]
Mm-hmm.

[SPEAKER_03]
So that you can get a chance to not be next to her.
Okay.
She will also not take an attack of opportunity on you because her human side does not want to eat you.

[SPEAKER_02]
Okay.
I'm going to retreat.

[SPEAKER_03]
Um, you're going to move.
Where are you moving?

[SPEAKER_02]
To, um, next to Bhaskar.

[SPEAKER_03]
Can you give me the thingy?
The plastic thing?
She has it.
You're going to have to keep this out because without the grid means that we must use it.
So this would be 30 feet.
Yeah.
So you're moving up the bass bar.
Yeah.
So basically you put this on top of your head and you can move to the outer rings for 30 feet.
If you want to move twice, you just move it again and do it again.
So this would be our... Can I see the candle?
Yeah, because it's flat.
It would be really hard to pick up if I put it down on the glass.
Okay.
All right, did you write down initiatives?
Did we do that yet?
I think we have not.

[SPEAKER_02]
When I reach them, since I have the action economy, I'm going to go ahead and bless the three of us.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
Okay.
Go ahead and roll.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]
No, no, it's just a spell.
I know.
Oh, initiative.

[SPEAKER_03]
Initiative.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where did you get?

[SPEAKER_02]
I had 22.
22?

[SPEAKER_03]
So you're up here.
Seven.

[SPEAKER_00]
Ten.

[UNKNOWN]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]
Aha, my name was written out full.
YouTube just got letters.
Well, mostly full.
You could add three more letters.

[SPEAKER_03]
Well, Christine is more than full letters, and Nicole is more than full letters, but I can manage full letters.

[SPEAKER_00]
Technically, mine is more than full letters.
Because there's an R-U-I at the end.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, but everybody calls you that.

[SPEAKER_00]
That is true.
That is true.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
It's a good game, guys.
So, Nicole goes first.

[SPEAKER_02]
When I reach there, I'm going to turn around in a voice of dual harmony, command Mara to halt.
I mean, it's a long shot, but I'm going to go ahead.
Wisdom, saving throw.
DC 13 for Mara.

[SPEAKER_01]
What type of roll is it?

[SPEAKER_02]
Wisdom saving throw.

[SPEAKER_01]
DC 13.

[SPEAKER_03]
run but it is you can't be talking right now i'm running oh you're doing something we got seconds
go again?

[SPEAKER_02]
Command.

[SPEAKER_03]
Command.

[SPEAKER_02]
To hold.

[SPEAKER_03]
She says, You are not the voice!
Angrily and out of control.
She called that.
She's twisted.
This is why you don't.
Okay.
Yeah.
She's a lesson not to do.

[SPEAKER_02]
Okay.
For terms of practicality, I'm going to
Use as much of my movement space to distance myself.

[SPEAKER_03]
Are you going up the tunnel?
Yeah.
I would say after that, she would say, We are the voice!
And you hear two or three or four vocal cords in one.
Not like how you do, more... Not harmoniously.
Not harmonious whatsoever.
Gut rule.
almost like part of her body and part of her human combining into more like just like if uh say three or three different monsters that were not human all saying the same thing it just doesn't it doesn't sound human okay nicole went it's uh i wrote us nine all right jaffee christine you're all level two i mean i'm just saying

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah, go ahead.
Well, that is a horror, sure enough.
Let's kill it.
I'm going to charge it.
Okay.
And hit it with my Warhammer.
It's probably really hard to trip.
Lots and lots of legs.

[SPEAKER_03]
I mean, you can go for it.
So you're moving up to it?
I'm going to move up to it.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, we didn't want to leave you in the back.

[SPEAKER_03]
To be clear, she's not quite screaming yet, but she does.
It's much louder than previously.
She's
Not a happy Santa Fe anymore.
It's like you don't want to be with her.
She just wants to be friends, Christine.
I know.

[SPEAKER_00]
I know.
Actually, you know what?
Because we might be attempting to flee, I think I will be using the battle axe.

[SPEAKER_02]
I think, yeah.
The plan is we're going to attempt to flee first, and if we can't, then we have to come back.

[SPEAKER_00]
We will see.
So yeah, I'll go ahead and take this one with the battle axe.
I don't know if this thing can be tripped, but if I hit... You are blessed, remember.
Oh, good.
I don't know if this thing can be tripped, but if it can be, I will be making the attempt if I hit.
Which I do not, because I natural won it.

[SPEAKER_03]
You... What weapon are you using?
Battle axe.
Natural one.
I am...
going to give you an inspiration point because you're going to need it.
Your axe hits land solid square against the shell of the centipede shattering into a thousand pieces the shards.
Oh, bad card.
You're going to have no weapons to your own land very soon.
Unnaturally so.
A large chunk of character like
You know, when something goes flying, you can't help but look and you just look as a piece of a solid piece of what was once a solid metal axe lands squarely into and embeds itself quite deeply into a wooden broken furniture to one side of the chamber.
The centipede didn't even notice you.
It is just looking straight at the witch of the party.
completely ignoring your presence.
Well done.
The dwarf comes up, and they're like, oh, crap, this is not, this is, you need, no, you're in the moment, but, you know.
Well, that was my action.

[SPEAKER_00]
I will, realizing that I probably can't hurt this thing, given that my axe exploded, I will kind of like,
pull the shield up, get behind it, and yell back to my friends, run!

[SPEAKER_03]
I love you, Bhaskar.

[SPEAKER_02]
Bhaskar is great.

[SPEAKER_03]
I think it's turn.
Yep.
Yep.
It goes before me, so...
It goes...
It goes to attack you.
And then it says, I'm not a monster.
We are the voice, but we are not a monster, but I am the voice.
We are going to eat you.
I am not going to eat you.
Cast, um... She casts his command.
What is the spell?
What's the word for that?
What do you need to roll for that?

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh, it's the save.
Oh, versus their DC.
Spell DC.

[SPEAKER_03]
And what...
Level 1. Who is she casting it on?
What's the command?
Because it's a one word thing.
You must run.

[SPEAKER_02]
Interesting.

[SPEAKER_03]
That's actually a 15.
So yeah, you passed.
The DC's 14.
You don't have to run.
But she also used her
Time to tell you to run, and you are compelled, magically so, to run.
She then crawls around you, not attacking or hurting you, and gets, and it's kind of like this, so you have some terrain you need to deal with, because she is a centipede, over here.
And she, her face is right next to your face.
and your action.
The bird's starting to fly down this one.
Okay, the bird is leaving now too.
Okay.
All right.

[SPEAKER_02]
If it can't fly, I can carry the bird.

[SPEAKER_03]
The bird is gonna flatter into its face to try to get its attention, I think.
But it's not really, it's pecking at it or it's trying to, but as you were warned,
This witch can smell its sisters.
Yes.
Uh... Can smell?
Is that the right word?
No.
More like... sense?
Or... As the... You know what's going on.
It wants to be whole again.
And it wants to be a part of the...
I know I'm casting a spell.
The question is which spell right now.
From my own experience and how it all feels to me, do I think an illusion might buy me some time by confusing the creature?
Or is the sense beyond that where it's not even worth trying?
Probably not going to get past illusion magic with this creature.
All right.
In that case, we're going to focus on hauling ass magic.
So I'm going to pull a petrified frog leg from my bag, snap it in half as I'm going to cast the jump spell on myself as a bonus action.
I'd like to use my action to disengage, that way it cannot attack of opportunity me.
Okay.
And I'm going to start booking it.
Booking.
So essentially with my movement, it's more than this, because it's...
because it would be 30 feet, but I can move an additional 20.
I'm not quite sure how to do that on this.

[SPEAKER_01]
Maybe like here?

[SPEAKER_03]
So I'm going to haul butt down there.
Actually, question.
Could I grab the crow again as I go to haul?
As I go to run?

[SPEAKER_02]
Probably not if you're disengaging.
I'm done.
Well, there's a

[SPEAKER_03]
I know.
I think the rule is strictly written, no, but narratively I kind of like it.
So because it's kind of, yeah, I'll let you do it.
I like it narratively that you're like, I need this.
I need you, yeah.
So Crows flies up in her face.
I'm like, nope, we're not doing that.
I'm going to take it, snap the frog leg, and then when I run down the hallway of Saber's, I get by you.
I just kind of like long leap forward, booking it down the tunnel.
And as I go... Actually, I don't think I have time to really talk here at this point.
So I need to see me hauling ass back out the way I came.
Jess is going to have tea time with her.
Yay!
All right, so that's top of the round with Nicole.

[SPEAKER_02]
Um, okay.
What can I do to help Asghar?

[SPEAKER_00]
I will say...
As funny as it is, with you two magic people who both have capability of magically speeding yourselves up in various travel forms, I am still the fastest person in this party.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm going to hold my action and I am going to run when Bazgar leaves that cave.
I will follow Marwyn once Bazgar is...
out of that, inside the tunnel, then I will run.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
So you're holding your action.

[SPEAKER_02]
So I'm holding my action to be ready to run, and I will act if that trigger applies.

[SPEAKER_03]
Fair enough.
How high is the ceiling in this room, in this cave room?
It's vaulted.

[SPEAKER_00]
Is it pretty high?
Yeah.
How tall is the ceiling?
length body of the centipede.
Is it jumpable?

[SPEAKER_03]
Or climbable?
You could climb over it with a... Like, if you wanted to climb over without it being a difficult terrain, it would be a skill check.
You basically have to hop over it like a goddamn hero.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah, I want to do it like a goddamn hero.
Basically, my goal is to get over it and get out of the cave as quickly as I can.
So I am willing to make...

[SPEAKER_03]
So you're going to be able to move 30 feet if you succeed at a hard check, and you'll be able to move half the distance if you're not able to succeed at a hard check.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay, let's try a hard check then.
This is athletics.
Yeah.
I may need to heroic inspiration this.
Or second wind it?

[SPEAKER_03]
I could second wind it.

[SPEAKER_02]
Do you have an inspiration?

[SPEAKER_03]
I do have an inspiration.
Okay.
I think I'm going to use the inspiration because I think second wind is very unlikely to succeed.
So I will...
Oh, it was a three, not an eight.

[SPEAKER_01]
Yeah, it was a three.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay, then I don't need second wind at this point.
That is a 20 athletics.
So you get to move... Is this 30 feet entire?
I think that's 20 feet.
And this is... No, this is a 15...
This is a 15-foot cone.
So this is 30 feet.
Okay.
This is a 15-foot cone.
Oh, is that a 15-foot cone?

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay, yeah.
Oh, okay.
So yeah, the...

[SPEAKER_03]
So this is 30 feet.
So you're able to move to here.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_03]
And then...

[SPEAKER_02]
At that point, I will also create distance, because that triggers my held action.

[SPEAKER_03]
Do you move 30 feet?

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
So it'll get right back up to me.
Yeah, I keep up to pace with you.
I think you get another move, right?

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah, I can dash as an action, and I don't need to use my action for anything else.
So I think I will dash the extra 30.
And that puts me in the backs, like between monster and it, so that's...
The bats aren't happy.

[SPEAKER_03]
I think Bazgar's happy.
I don't need to go faster than that right now.
Monster turn?
It's monster turn.
She says... She screams down the tunnel, and the tunnel being so enclosed makes her voice echo and reverb off these solid stone walls like nothing you've ever heard before.
She says, We said stop!
And at the very end, this completely becomes into darkness.
Almost as if to no longer exist.
That's spooky.
And she, yeah, she can make it.
She makes it all the way back up to your face again.
Ignoring you entirely.
Okay, your guys' turn.
Well, my turn now, right?
Yeah.
I'm gonna utter, kind of a little bit breathless, because we're still running, wants me.
In case you guys haven't figured that out by now.
You know what?
I'm going to try to create more distance, see if I can take some of the heat off my friends.
If she wants to take a swing at me, she'll be able to, so I'm gonna save my action to be able to run even further.
She doesn't want to kill you.
Okay.
She wants to wear you.

[UNKNOWN]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
So if she lets me go then, then I'm going to do another jump, and then I will also use my action to dash, which is going to get me pretty damn far.
Probably run the bend.
It's here, plus the dash, so I'm going to book it up the tunnel and 20 feet beyond that.
Okay, wait, I need... Once everyone gets to that point, it's a different scene.
Okay.
So at the end of this scene, winning this immediate combat is getting to where Christine is, so she is no longer in combat.
I think it's Sabriel, right?

[SPEAKER_01]
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

[SPEAKER_02]
Vazgar is going to try to run around her.

[SPEAKER_03]
Vazgar is going to try and run around her, yes.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
And I have...
I think I'm good.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, this is the funny thing about being friends.
I have another held action.
I'm going to hold action until Basgar reaches five feet of me.
And then I'm going to teleport.
Oh, crap.
I'm not a green one right now.

[SPEAKER_03]
I'll let you roll.
No, I think it would be obvious.
You don't need to roll.
I'm just going to send you a message.

[SPEAKER_02]
Okay.
I'm going to pace with Basgar.
If it looks like Basgar is faster than me, I will face up.
So I'm just waiting until Basgar reaches me.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay.
Bazgar is going to outpace you.
Yeah.
I'm going to start burning stuff.

[SPEAKER_02]
So yeah, if Bazgar reaches the point where I am, I'm going to face up and then run.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
So then I think probably between all three of us, we can reach the end before her turn.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, it's going to happen with burning resources.

[SPEAKER_00]
I am going to move up, use my action to scatter caltrops.
Oh!
So that we have a little bit of something to slow her down, and then bonus action dash with Adrenaline Rush.

[SPEAKER_02]
So you will be leaving her... Yeah, but you can teleport beyond it.
Yeah, but Opportunity Attack on Basilar, right?

[SPEAKER_00]
Yes, if she chooses to swing at me for moving past, I will trigger an Attack of Opportunity.

[SPEAKER_02]
But I won't, because I'm face-stepping and then running.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]
Does she choose to swing at me as I run past?

[SPEAKER_03]
Attack opportunity.
Um... She does not care about you.
Okay.
She just... You just really creep... You get a very clear close look at this creature.
It is... Disgusting.
Like...
If...
It's literally a...
human-sized centipede that is everything of a monster you know is a monster.
Okay, do you get out?
Do you want to get out?
Let me move the next scene.
Um, and then Jeff did drop caltrops behind to help slow her down.
Okay.
Yeah, I got caltrops.
Well, now I don't, but I did.
I like it.
I will keep that in mind, because you're not out yet.
Yeah.
Roll home, but here.

[SPEAKER_01]
And

[SPEAKER_03]
I have alcohol.
Sorry about our first ruin dive.

[SPEAKER_02]
It's not going so well, guys.

[SPEAKER_03]
I was like, really?
Brightside, I'm going to basically be a floodgate of information.
You really want to know Christine's side?
Really?
Really?
I don't know, Christine.
I may not be holding many cards to my chest after this whole encounter.
So...
It opens up, from that tunnel, it opens up to a huge opening.
So this just becomes a huge cave on one side.
You see a long, that is more smaller.
It is a long, narrow bridge across a deep, deep cascism.
And on the other side, there it is.
a cave network.
And there's the ledge, frankly.
It's just a tiny ledge over here.
Very tiny.
The characters are over here.
The bird, as soon as the bird gets into the cataclysm, he takes a flight over the...
It's huge.
He can just fly.
Now it's trying to outpace us.
Yeah.
But he's not because he doesn't know where to go.
He's just actually just circ...
I would say he's probably more like taking circular...
to kind of be able to get, lack of a better word, an area view of the situation, but there's no clear way out.
And these aren't actually obstacles, I'm just trying to show that there's holes, like this is just a hole in this rope bridge where the wood is no longer.
Yeah, it's not the most safest of bridges.
into, and over here, just deeper into tunnel mazes and the labyrinth of the ancient civilization.
We roll your initiatives.

[SPEAKER_01]
Ten.

[SPEAKER_03]
Five.
Thirteen.
Okay, Jeff, your character gets the first move.
I guess Jeff.
What's your roll?
That was a five, so it's ten for Gabriel, and then I'm last again.

[SPEAKER_02]
Probably pretty shaken.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, Marvin's a bit freaked out.
This is not supposed to happen on day, like, three in Ardenhaven.
Let's see.
You guys want to know more about Ardenhaven?

[SPEAKER_02]
Ardenhaven.
I'm excited.
This unlocks so much new inspiration.
Are you sure?
You really want to go down that hole?

[SPEAKER_03]
You're only level two.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay.
I've seen you can teleport.

[SPEAKER_03]
I've seen she can jump really far.
But I have specifically seen she can't jump that far.
Yeah, I cannot clear this bridge.
In one go.

[SPEAKER_00]
Let me do some quick thinking.
Okay.
Okay.
So, um, I think I am going to, uh, scoop up Marwen and I am going to book it across the bridge.
I am going to, uh, you know, if I have to jump gaps, I'm going to jump gaps.
I'm going to just try and get across as fast as possible.

[SPEAKER_03]
There is a degree of luck here.
That's fine.
So roll the luck dice to see if you get unlucky.
It's a lot of weight.

[SPEAKER_00]
And I am willing to spend an adrenaline rush to dash, an action surge to dash, my action to dash, and my movement to move if I need to.

[SPEAKER_03]
Would that be 120 feet?

[SPEAKER_00]
If I'm carrying somebody, I think it cuts in half.
Oh, so 60 feet.
But I can get the two of us
Certainly, assuming bad luck doesn't happen, that's certainly... Are you scooping over, like, a fireman's carry?
It's like going graceful, right?
Scooping it off and fireman carrying, and... Oh, you're still blessed.

[SPEAKER_02]
I don't know.
It doesn't affect luck dice, but... Four.

[SPEAKER_01]
Four.
All right, loading acrobatics.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay.
Definitely going to use a second wind on that.
So...
What is the tactical mind?

[SPEAKER_03]
Nine.
You get...
Your leg goes through...
Your leg goes through a plank early.
It just breaks.
And you have to grab hold of the rope.
And thankfully, just because you are a very strong orc, you're able to not drop your package down into the chasm below.
You're scared to death, though.
You see the dark days below for a moment, and you're like, ah.
Yeah, I didn't pick up that scroll of feather fall.
This would be bad.

[SPEAKER_02]
We should go get one.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah.
Is this, so, how much do I have to spend to have gotten that far?
Like, obviously my movement.
That's just your movement.
That's just the movement?
Okay.
Yeah.
I think role-wise, that would have been your action, too, because you were... Action as well.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

[SPEAKER_03]
But I...
I will keep... You can't...
So, I think it's one role per turn, so we go through players quickly.
So, you did a role, so that's your action, but not your movement.
But you used your action and movement, but you still get a movement.
Okay.
Um...
But I'm also treating you probably as prone, because you don't have to take that movement to probably unprone yourself.
Yeah, I am willing to spend some movement to get up, the half movement to get up.
So basically what that is, is that you broke through, caught yourself, and you used that half movement to basically get back onto the bridge and not going through.
And now you know, like, oh yeah, the bridge is also rocking.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah, but we don't have a lot of choice in the matter.
So then I am going to use my orcish adrenaline rush to get some more distance.
Keep moving.
If I fall through again, that's going to suck, but I am going to keep going.

[SPEAKER_03]
You don't get another roll, but you do get a roll and another luck.
Okay.
That's kind of funny.
Six.
You got very lucky.
You get to move your normal movements if there was no terrain here.
And I'll be very clear.
You cannot move yourself into an empty gap.
Yeah, I figured.
I'll be very clear.
You just got really lucky.
You're running, your leg's moving at full pace.
And every step, you're... You know how people are like, I've done this.
I climbed this tree once and every branch I grabbed on broke underneath of me.
And then I got up the tree and there were no branches underneath of me.
Kind of sad.
Anyways, that's kind of what's happening here.
As you're running through this bridge, you are breaking the bridge.
I know.
Sabriel.
Um...
Question.
Dig down the other side.

[SPEAKER_00]
Is there something on the other side that one could hook a grappling hook to?

[SPEAKER_03]
Um... Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
You...

[SPEAKER_00]
It's action hero time.

[SPEAKER_03]
You would...
Yes, but it's unlikely to do so unassisted if only you had a companion that could fly and understand English.
Let's see.
I am going to...
But yeah, I would say I imagine it to be mostly sparse.
I won't say it's not possible.
I would say it's unlikely without some sort of intervention to help it hook.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay.
So that might not be the right way unless I can get the raven to obey me, which I'm skeptical about.

[SPEAKER_03]
Hank, the raven, you did hear the raven talk.
I mean, it's fair.
It sounded like the raven, for the few words the raven said, the raven sounds like a talking raven, like a crow.
Crows can actually talk.
When did the crow talk?
You said, Ron, and the crow said, there's no sky.
Oh, that was actual, okay.
I thought it was more giving me the look like there's no sky.
It said there's no sky.
Yes.
Gotcha.
Gotcha.
But he did, or he or she did say it, like you're a goddamn idiot.
Okay.
Like...
How the crow's been acting.
Look, it completely tracks.
Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]
Then I think I am going to yell out to the crow, hook this on something for Marwyn!
And I'm going to tie one end of my rope to Marwyn.
I can action surge if I need another action to do this.

[SPEAKER_03]
I will take another action surge.
The crow elegantly sweeps down, grabs a hook, and...
carries it to the other side, and puts in, lashes it securely.
Far above and beyond what a bird can typically be able to do.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah, I'm getting that.

[SPEAKER_03]
And that's every single potential action I can take in a turn.

[SPEAKER_02]
Wider action economy, though.
Good job, Jeff.

[SPEAKER_03]
And now we have a safety hook, so if the bridge goes down, we have a rope.
When the bridge goes down.
When the bridge goes down.
We have a rope around Marwen.
So it was Nicole.
Oh, yeah.
Right, it's Jeff, Nicole, Chris, and Nicole.
You see that Jeff, this ogre, has literally knocked down half of the bridge.
As he's walking.
And I do, and I know you know he's an orc, but I can't imagine your character struggles to think of him anything but a big ogre.
Because no reasonable mammal could be so clumsy.
It's almost cartoonish.
It's the destruction behind this guy.

[SPEAKER_02]
I have a concern that if I step onto the bridge that will be...
I'm an elf, I know I don't really weigh that much, and I typically can walk on snow, but would I endanger the bridge in snapping if I were to also put my weight on it and follow them?

[SPEAKER_03]
It seems that the ropes are good, the boards are not.

[SPEAKER_00]
So the bridge wouldn't likely come down, but you're just as much risk of the boards breaking.

[SPEAKER_03]
But that's...
Now that said, you are way lighter than these two together.
And you're an elf.
You're magically thin.
You can just run along the rope.

[SPEAKER_02]
I was thinking about it.
If I go half speed, can I go mainly along the ropes?
Rather than stepping foot center on a board, use the edge, have the rope kind of
Spread the weight.

[SPEAKER_01]
Spread the weight.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah.
I'm going to move half, so probably Christina can't reach.

[SPEAKER_03]
So half would be to about here.
Yeah.
So you'd really just get to the start of it.
But that's only your movement if you want to use your action to dash or something.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah, I would do that.
So I'm going much more slowly but carefully as to not...
Not cause irreparable damage.

[SPEAKER_00]
Image of us, like, firing and shoulder-charging through the whole thing, and then Sabriel just kind of, like, gently walking across, taking their time and being careful.

[SPEAKER_02]
Mm-hmm.
One hand on the, you know.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
To the top of the round?
No, no, Christine, sorry, I almost forgot about you.
I figured you're dead already.
Nope, not yet.

[SPEAKER_00]
Nope, and if you want to get down and make, you know, continue moving, go for it.
That's the idea is to get you more distance so you can make it across.

[SPEAKER_03]
You two need to get to the other side.
Working on it.
But yeah, if you put me down, I will go down.
And what I think I'm going to go ahead and do here because I... Gosh.
Here's the problem.
She's going to be coming up onto the bridge soon.
I think I'm going to go ahead and still get some distance because that will probably still... Well...
Here's the catch.
The rope is tied to me.
There's not a rope tied to Basgar.
Correct.
Yep.

[UNKNOWN]
Oh, crap.

[SPEAKER_00]
If the bridge snaps, I'll just grab the rope then.
I'm a badass.
It's okay.

[SPEAKER_02]
Distance is still the name of the game here.

[SPEAKER_03]
It is, but I know she's going to come to me wherever I am.
Um...
I think I am going to stay with Bazgar because I want him to have another rope accessible even if it's around me if something does happen here.

[SPEAKER_02]
Like I've been doing, you can hold your timing.
Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]
And here's the thing I think I'm going to do.
This is stupid.
I'm going to try it anyway.
I'm going to ready a produce flame if
Mara comes out onto the bridge.
I'm going to hurl it at the boards and see where she's going to go to maybe help the bridge fall out from under her.
Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]
The boards, not the ropes.

[SPEAKER_03]
The boards, not the ropes.
What is it?
It's a cantrip.
It's the only thing I have at range like that.
Okay.
So is it prepared action?
Yes.
Okay.
Now it is...
I mean, the whole bridge might collapse, and then we get to do action.

[SPEAKER_02]
Now he's still got to carry you, though, because you're readying your attack action.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yep.
Cal chops.
Cal chops.
If it breaks, then he has access to the rope around me.
Roll me a luck dice.
Nope.
No!
That is a one.
So...
I mean, your acts didn't do much, so... Yeah.

[SPEAKER_00]
R.A.P.
one.
You're here.
Battleaxe.

[SPEAKER_03]
You can see down the tunnel the light that was radiating from her chamber go dark blocked by a large centipede body and you see stretching far along the floor of the cave system thin arm-like appendages
that is of her many little legs looming over the three of you, yet not in view.
Not yet.
Okay.
It's like the shadow of the three of you.
It's the shadow of the centipede, long, stretching, like, so, like, you see, you know how, like, shadows tend to really...
if they're in a sharp angle it really takes like the little yeah so you see like the little the little many many many little legs going all the way down the whole thing from her hundreds of legs sort of being and of course it kind of fades out here but it's very looming and you know that she is just around the corner that's why I asked
how much this is gonna be a problem.
Okay, uh, is... Am I up?
You're up.
You're up.
This is the last round before she does go around the corner.
So, win condition, be over the bridge.

[SPEAKER_00]
Well, I think we now have a safety net for the two of us.
So, when Marwyn turns around and, like, readies and starts to, like, be ready to, uh, throw fire,
Baz has other priorities, and that is keeping you alive.
So I think he just grabs and keeps going.
Yeah.
We've got a rope now.
It'll be fine.

[SPEAKER_01]
It'll be fine.

[SPEAKER_00]
So I'm going to jump the gap here as carefully as I can while carrying somebody, which is not very careful.

[SPEAKER_03]
Tell me what your goal is, and that will determine the difficulty.
The bigger the goal, the harder it is.
The smaller the goal is.
Do you want to be all the way over here?
That's probably a hard... Yeah, that's a hard check, because I think you can move there.
You have the movement.

[SPEAKER_01]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
You have the movement.
It'll be a hard check, 15, unless you can bullshit it.
Bullshit it.
Give me some, like, practical, creative reason that makes it easier for you.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.
I can't think of any way to make running across a bridge easier, given things like I'm not the super acrobat.
Like, I don't have that skill set.

[SPEAKER_03]
Um...
So I think I'm just going to have to try and make the hard check.
But I need to get us across, so I think I'm going to try and make the hard check.
Hope I roll good.
You have another second one, right?
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
Hey, Joe, I got what you wanted.
What?
Natural one.

[SPEAKER_00]
I don't have a Heroic Inspiration, so I can't reroll it.
Yep.

[SPEAKER_03]
Okay.
So you got an active one, and you're trying to get to the... Just trying to get to the other side?
Yep.
Trying to get us to the other side.
I've got...
Pulling Marwen.
Half of the bridge breaks.
This whole rope snaps.
Uh-oh.
Everyone who, um... You failed, so you don't have to roll again, but you're gonna have to roll something to hold on to the ropes.
Can I...
So, he...
He failed, but he was holding on to me, and the rope is around me.
I think you swing down with the rope.
Yeah, I think we're just gonna swing, but if he's holding on to me, I'm, like, the weight for the rope.
So he wouldn't, like...
I don't know if you hold on to him.
You know, it's your turn next, so...
Um, right?
Jeff?
No, Jeff.
It goes, this is happening in seconds.
Yeah.
So, he failed.
He's dropping you.
I'm, I'm trying to.
And so, on your turn, you can decide if you want to hold on to him, if you want to hold on to Bridge, if you want to, like, like, swing down, I mean, swinging down and hitting that wall is going to hurt.
Yep.
You'll probably survive it, but you will not survive it
Without taking some fall damage.
I understand.
Did you roll one?
What did you roll?
Four!

[SPEAKER_02]
That's with my dex save bonus.

[SPEAKER_03]
You get to pick.
I'm gonna write three things on my paper.

[SPEAKER_01]
Kargorum?
Are there great ones?

[SPEAKER_02]
Great campaign, guys.
This is so much fun.

[SPEAKER_00]
There is a discount for each dead adventurer.

[SPEAKER_03]
That's right.
There we go.
So I'll get some money back.
I am...
I'm going to give you three broad things.
And you can pick which one.
You can pick something materialistic.
You can pick...
Something that is bodily.
And you can pick something with being in a worse location.

[SPEAKER_02]
Worse location.

[SPEAKER_03]
The bridge.
You trying to save yourself causes the other line.

[SPEAKER_02]
I would let go before it snapped.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, it happens like that.
The bridge snaps.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
Entirely.
And you swing down this way.

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh, I thought I was going to fall all the way down.

[SPEAKER_03]
No, no, no.
That was probably a natural one.
And you didn't get a natural one, so I am giving you some leeway.
But now, this bridge, basically, and I'm not doing it yet because things are happening in seconds.
You are now both tumbling like...
that towards this wall but I have to say the length this is literally what 30 feet 40 feet yep so imagine that is like imagine being at the top of my house 40 feet out and with the rope and now swinging down like a pendulum to the wall like that's probably not forced to break your legs if you're you know probably will no matter how you cut it let me put this right if you don't have that rope
tied to your arm or body, you're probably leaving it impossible to hold onto the rope unless you're, you know... Well, it's tied around my, like, my waist, right?
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_00]
Mm-hmm.

[SPEAKER_03]
Is that what you did?

[SPEAKER_00]
So...

[SPEAKER_03]
So on my turn, Joe...
Your turn.
I'm grabbing on to Basgar.
We're doing that swing.
I know it's going to hurt.
And...
But I also know Basgar is going to be the best suited to be able to get us back out when we hit that wall.
So I would even say in terms of if one of us has to take the brunt of it, I'm going to take the brunt.

[SPEAKER_00]
Oh, you're crazy.

[SPEAKER_03]
If you take the brunt, you're going to kill this girl if you land on her.

[SPEAKER_00]
I don't want to land on her.

[SPEAKER_03]
She's going to be...
I'm going...
I'm tougher than I look.
It's not my turn.

[SPEAKER_00]
I am tougher than you.
If I could... And she's trying to put herself between me and the wall.

[SPEAKER_03]
Do you want to action hero it?

[SPEAKER_00]
I would definitely action hero that and take the brunt of that.

[SPEAKER_03]
Because here's the difference.

[SPEAKER_02]
You're actually both fairly tall.

[SPEAKER_03]
If you go unconscious, I cannot haul you out of here.
If I go unconscious, you can haul me out of here.

[SPEAKER_02]
And she's still tied to the rope.

[SPEAKER_03]
It can't knock me unconscious.
That's fair.

[SPEAKER_02]
All right.
So Basgar's taking the brunt.

[SPEAKER_03]
We're going to swing, Jen.
I'm hanging on.
I don't want to lose him.
Okay.
Um, the bastard's taking the brunt.
I'm gonna take the brunt.
Hit me.
Wall.
There's gonna be 40 sets of fall damage.
Yep.
Excellent.

[SPEAKER_00]
Oh my god.

[SPEAKER_03]
That'd be 10, 12, 13 damage.
I am bloodied.
Longening.
And how much do I take?
Do you land on him?
I'm landing on him.
He's taking the brunt, but I'm coming after.
You take 12 damage.
Jeez.
Okay.
You know, that could damage.
Do you have a weapon on you?
I have a warhammer on my belt.
Do you have a knife?
I do have a knife.
Your knife gets lodged into you.
Ow.
It's fine.
Yeah, I'm bloodied as well, but I'm not that bad.
I'm not down or anything, so.
Bad.
Yeah, it's bad.
Yeah.
Okay, because I can't think of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, let's see.
Whose turn is this?
Is it Monster's turn now?
It's Monster's turn.
And you went already, right?

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
Well, I had a... A reaction.
A reaction.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
So now, the center P...
Well, you guys are not over here.
Yep.
And there's no more bridge, so good luck.
Now, the thing is, she doesn't see you yet.
She's just looking over this chasm, and she screams, like, not as vehement, but as if it's some sort of sanatory creature, and paces back and forth, not sure how to tend to the situation.
Asgard, we need to climb.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yeah.
Yeah, I will climb.
Hold on.
Hold on to my back.
Okay.
Okay, let's...
This is athletics.
We can do that.
Does a 10 pass?
It does.
Okay, because I can go higher if I need to.

[SPEAKER_03]
No, you have a rope.
It sucks, but with a rope...
Rope is a rope, and this rope is holding, so you get up all the way to the top.
Okay.
Now, you with your darkvision might actually have a chance to see Sabriel.
I know, I have no idea what happened to you.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm at the, well, you're what, 120 feet?
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_00]
Is Sabriel alive?
They're stuck on the other side.

[SPEAKER_03]
I don't know how to get them over here.
I don't either.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, we're not done with the conflict yet.

[SPEAKER_03]
So then it's, what, your turn?

[SPEAKER_02]
Is it my turn?

[SPEAKER_03]
Yes, because she took her turn pacing back and forth.
At the edge of the ledge.
Yeah, so Nicole, she doesn't know you're down there.
She's just...

[SPEAKER_02]
So I have an idea and I would need a little leeway from you to make it function because I don't mechanically have the ability to do this.

[SPEAKER_00]
Explain it to me.

[SPEAKER_02]
I would like to use Guiding Bolt to blast her off the ledge into the chasm.
Guiding Bolt does not have a push ability, but it is my big blasty spell.

[SPEAKER_03]
Is this supposed to blind her?

[SPEAKER_02]
Uh, it's radiant damage.
So it is, like, a radiant damage.

[SPEAKER_03]
Maybe you could, like, if she's at the edge, maybe you could, like, shoot the rock and if enough of that gateway in front of her.

[SPEAKER_02]
I mean, I was willing to just shove her off after hitting her with the blunt, like, with the radiant damage.

[SPEAKER_03]
Well, I'm likely to break it.
You know, she has, like, a thousand legs.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah, I don't have the strength, I think, to accomplish that.

[SPEAKER_03]
So I'm having a
part-time imagining that happening.
Because even if you, like, push up the upper part of her body, she has a lower part of the body.
I think you need to actually, like, break the stones or something.

[SPEAKER_02]
I can tremor the ground, and...

[SPEAKER_03]
The other part here is that, like, you are against a wall.
There is more down into the darkness.
Mm-hmm.
Can she see...

[SPEAKER_00]
To the bottom from where she's hanging, 60 feet of darkvision?
Is there a bottom?

[SPEAKER_03]
A bottom within whatever the rope distance down plus the 60?
Nicole is the one who needs to inquiry.

[SPEAKER_02]
I still have spell slots.

[SPEAKER_03]
Take your time.
It's a harsh situation, but right now she doesn't know you're down there.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah, I don't, yeah, not like that.

[SPEAKER_03]
I would discourage engaging her.

[SPEAKER_02]
Mm-hmm.
Unless there was a way to shove her off, that was my current thought.
Yeah, something that, yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
That was my thought.
If she got in on the bridge before it broke, then I think we would have had a shot.
Yes, if she was on the bridge, that was reasonable.
But one of the things about her is that she's a centipede.

[SPEAKER_02]
So she doesn't know I'm there.

[SPEAKER_03]
She does not know you're there.

[SPEAKER_02]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_03]
You projected, you know, there might be things below you, there might be things beside of you.

[SPEAKER_02]
I was thinking of trying to divert her down a path if she thinks there's another way around.

[SPEAKER_03]
I mean, she might give up.
Sometimes the best course of action is just chilling.

[SPEAKER_02]
I am actually comfortable with that.

[SPEAKER_03]
In case she can go a heist.
You can roll your hide.
It will be... Oh, okay.
Sorry.
The early DM would be fine, but this DM wants you to die.
I'm going to have you roll...
It's going to be super easy.
You're in the dark.
It can't see you.
It can't sense you.
It's not hunting for you.
You're nice to it, so even if
The whole sorry part of it wouldn't want to see you.
So, just a five.

[SPEAKER_02]
Okay.
I'm just gonna do the thing that I'm actually very good at and go very still and kind of almost become detached from the situation.
Like, she's horrifying and right in front of me and all our lives are at stake.
But to Sabriel...
They've dealt with worse tantrums.

[SPEAKER_01]
What?
No.

[SPEAKER_02]
Not often, no.
Go ahead.
I'm actually going to seek the silver thread inside of me and just be very quiet.
It's not great.
Eleven.
No.
Sorry, nine.

[SPEAKER_01]
Okay.

[UNKNOWN]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm thinking.

[SPEAKER_00]
Mm-hmm.

[SPEAKER_03]
I'll get back to you.

[SPEAKER_02]
That's fine.

[SPEAKER_03]
Um...
But from you guys, you can't see her.
You probably don't.
There's no way, even if you knew she was over there, there's nothing you could do about it.
I need to get back to the sky.
I need to send the crow to Elder Marith now.
She'll handle this.
It's the best we can do for Sabriel.
All right.
I don't know what that means, but I am going to trust you.
Let's do this.
So you guys get to, you probably need to let go of your wounds.
You probably head deeper into the, you don't know where you're at at this point.
You head deeper into the ruins and you probably find a place to stop.
The crow, yeah, the crow would say that.
We don't have to stop Joe.
No, that's what the crow said.
I know, but... No, no, no.
Do you talk to the crow?
And...
It's not like you did any better back there.
Go down the spooky hallway.

[SPEAKER_00]
They also hooked the grappling hook.

[SPEAKER_03]
The crow does sound like
It does not sound like a magical voice.
It sounds like... Crow voice.

[SPEAKER_01]
Crow voice.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah.
I'm not saying that Cinder here didn't help.
I'm saying that you froze up, same as me back there.
This was not part of the instructions.
Nobody accounted for being inside of a tunnel when this event occurred.
But when someone events, speak which spell, let me know.
I'm going to turn away from the crow.
If we're going to short rest, I guess, is what we're doing.
What you implied there, Joe?
Yeah.
We're taking some time.
I'm going to set an alarm back down the hallway, a ways away from where we are.
That way, if anything starts coming this way, that I will be mentally alerted.
Did you get the insult?
Did you hear what the girl said?
What did it say?
Well, when someone events.
Yeah, speak, speak English.
Yeah.
Let me, let me know.
Oh, I got that.
They like the fact that I used speak with animals on a, we're very good at that.
It's response was to say cough.
Yeah, that's exactly it.
All right.
So I do want to finish up a little bit with you.
Yeah.
You get a short rest.
Maybe.
You guys are resting, and you come out.
You're not sure how you got there, but you got there.

[SPEAKER_02]
Do you want to have the conversation since I pulled on the silver thread?

[SPEAKER_03]
No, you just black out and wake up again.
It was, but there's something.
Let me think.
It's very unsettling.
And didn't feel like the silver for you now.

[SPEAKER_02]
I like that.

[SPEAKER_03]
So, if Sabriel comes to join us, I did not...

[SPEAKER_02]
This is where I just walk out the room.

[SPEAKER_03]
Well, I'm specifying...
That the alarm will not go off for you, so probably mental alarm will go off, and when you open up the door, you're probably greeted to a warhammer and a fire ready to go.
Sabriel?

[SPEAKER_00]
Yes?
You are not dead!
Yes!

[SPEAKER_03]
I give you a hug.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm gonna hug you back.

[SPEAKER_03]
You're just as confused as anyone else.

[SPEAKER_02]
I'm confused, yeah.
I probably don't hug, not because I wouldn't, but just because I'm confused.

[SPEAKER_03]
How did you get out of there?
They can teleport.
Oh, right.

[SPEAKER_02]
Don't expect me to do teleportation of that distance, Vazgar.
You're overestimating some capabilities.

[SPEAKER_00]
Oh, so it is only in the dire circumstances that your powers grow to that extent?
I understand.
Dire circumstances are great for teleportation.

[SPEAKER_03]
Boosting up one's power.
Getting stronger.
I just feel a strong urge to look at that book again.

[SPEAKER_02]
I am going to look at it.
Like, if we're resting here, I'm going to look at it.
But I will come back to this conversation.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, and it's just blank.
It's so frustrating.
It's so blank.

[SPEAKER_02]
If I tried to touch the silver head, do I get the sense that the connection is...

[SPEAKER_03]
closed right not closed power wise but like she's not answering you it your character is very confused it doesn't there's something more here you don't know what it is but it's pulling at you it like you know you know this book is yours you don't know how you know the book feels you feel uh this after this confusion
you feel something about this book, you are just, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't feel right, but it feels familiar, but not, it's like, it's like, I'm trying to think of a good way to phrase it, it's like an off-brand of
really anything that's not actually the brand.
You know, if you have, like, you have the brand name, you have the off-brand, and you have, like, the, like, the, you're pretty sure this isn't legal off-brand.
Like, this feels like you're pretty sure this isn't legal type of off-brand feeling from whatever this is.

[SPEAKER_02]
Oh, the thing that happened to me is the off-brand feeling?
Not my book, right?

[SPEAKER_03]
Both.

[SPEAKER_02]
I don't want that.

[SPEAKER_03]
They all feel all sorts of off-brand.

[UNKNOWN]
Okay.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yeah, go ahead.
It still feels like the still side of magic.
Strange.
It is strange.
Your character should be freaked out.

[SPEAKER_02]
No, Sabriel is freaked out.
The way that manifests is very stoically.
Like, they're not... You're an elf!
Yeah.
But I think they kind of not...
Not to be rude, but they do kind of brush off the situation a little bit.
Not in a dismissing its importance, but in like, I can't explain it.
Either she's upset with me, or she's not, or something is wrong.
That shouldn't have happened.

[SPEAKER_03]
As in, is that something you're saying?

[SPEAKER_02]
Yes.

[SPEAKER_03]
Who, what's she, Mara?

[SPEAKER_02]
No, Alaris.

[SPEAKER_03]
You mentioned that name once before.
Hang on, let me confirm with my, double check with my notes what you call her.
That's your goddess, yes.

[SPEAKER_02]
I reached out to her to say goodbye.
Like, I thought it was the end, and she would never see me again.
And she didn't answer.
And then I was here.
But something did.

[SPEAKER_00]
And that book is the book that Marowin stole, and it is blank?

[SPEAKER_02]
It's somehow connected to all this.
It just feels wrong, but it belongs to me, and I can't read it.

[SPEAKER_00]
May I look?
I'm going to take a look at the... You said the front symbol is some kind of sun or starburst or something that's nothing specifically meaning anything.
I do not know magic, but have you tried reading it in different lights?
Daylight, moonlight, starlight, things like that?

[SPEAKER_02]
Some moonlight.
Mainly I've been working at night, but... Hmm.

[UNKNOWN]
Hmm.

[SPEAKER_03]
I'm kind of looking over Sabriel with what they just shared.
Does anything seem different about Sabriel?
Like they may have lost something in this experience?
Sabriel?
Yes.
Who's Sabriel?
Nicole's character.
Oh, lost something?
Because Nicole was saying that they went to say goodbye to Alarith, their goddess, and something else answered.

[SPEAKER_02]
No, something didn't.

[SPEAKER_03]
Something didn't answer.

[SPEAKER_02]
Well, something happened, but no one answered me.

[SPEAKER_03]
So I'm trying to see if there might have been an exchange.
Oh.
Just curiosity there.
No.
I understand what you're saying.
Do you want to go fix sometimes?
Yeah.
But no, it's not that.

[SPEAKER_00]
Okay.
I do have a follow-up question.
The fuck was that?

[SPEAKER_03]
That was Sister Mara.
We just met today.

[SPEAKER_02]
Not your literal sister.

[SPEAKER_03]
No.
Mara is not well.
No kidding.
And...
You might have gathered there's not much of her left.
She needs to be put down.
We're not capable of doing that.
We need help to do so.
This crow is from Elder Marith.
Cinder.
If we can cinder.
Now you like it?
That's it, yeah, I like it.
If we can get back to the open sky, Crow Cinder should know their way back to her.
I need to mark this territory.
It is not safe for any to enter here until she is dealt with.
What she's capable of is potentially anything.
She could appear right here, right now.
and devour her.
She could bring this whole mountain down.
There's a... We don't know.
It's unpredictable at this point.

[SPEAKER_02]
Is she a god?

[SPEAKER_03]
No.
I told you.
She's a witch of Elderholt.
Hmm.
I know very little about the witches of Elderholt.
They're supposed to be pretty dangerous, though.
And there's your mare.
What was your character's name?
Marwyn.
And there's your Marwyn.

[UNKNOWN]
God.

[SPEAKER_00]
We are dangerous.
This explains a lot.

[SPEAKER_03]
What Cinder is getting at, I am a very young witch.
This is my first time leaving home.

[SPEAKER_02]
Would you become like her?

[SPEAKER_03]
Have a seat.

[SPEAKER_02]
I just put more specifically, do you age into something like her, would be the question.
Because you mentioned being young and that sort of thing.

[SPEAKER_03]
So, I don't know what the other magical traditions are.
I wasn't aware much about them beforehand.
But in ours, there are exchanges between
that are necessary.
There are two paths.
The first of which, the one, the one I hope to aspire to, we refer to as ward witches.
That were to happen, I would take on markings to
hold back the necessary sacrifices.
It's a very careful, exacting path.
It requires a lot of restraint.
And then there are the deep witches.
Deep witches, they experience their bargains, their exchanges.
You know what they're dominated in this game?
What?
I took a deep side and you know what to do.
It's okay.
I don't know if that was Cinder being judgmental or not.
The crow is behaving her himself for now.
Mara went this path, but the danger is you can bargain away enough of yourself that you stop being human, elf, dwarf, whatever you were before.
You stop being... You then belong to it.

[SPEAKER_01]
What is it?
Mara!

[SPEAKER_00]
I cannot speak of it.

[SPEAKER_03]
But every exchange has an equal measure.
Sometimes it will give something for free.
It's very, very precious when it happens.
Mara back there got something for free and still could, which I didn't know was possible.

[SPEAKER_02]
What did she get for free?

[SPEAKER_03]
The other tunnel was closed off in front of us.
We could not flee in that direction.

[SPEAKER_02]
That was a gift from...

[SPEAKER_03]
That tunnel may no longer exist.
It may never have existed.
It could be completely sealed through.
It could just be a wall.
I don't know.
It all depends on what she asked for.

[SPEAKER_02]
That was the type of power you were afraid of.

[SPEAKER_00]
That's the type of power I have.
But if I call upon it, there will be a cost.
And the reason you fear these earth-shattering, city-destroying powers is because there is a cost to those as well.
Yes.
I imagine a very expensive cost.

[SPEAKER_03]
So, I don't know how that compares to your goddess, but that's why I have a different perspective.
If you want the most powerful magics, if you need help, go to Elderhold and ask for it.
And maybe a witch will be
willing to help you.

[SPEAKER_02]
That's not the type of power I was talking about.

[SPEAKER_00]
But it might be the kind of power I am.

[SPEAKER_03]
I will think on this.
When I offer to go with you, to help you, if we grow stronger together,
That was as good as if you had come to Elder Holt and had petitioned and I offered my assistance.
I'm...
I'm not worth much yet.
But you will be.

[SPEAKER_01]
Who's Raven's witch?

[SPEAKER_03]
It's Elder Merith, the Asher Merger.
Merith likes you.
She has a funny way of showing it.
I'm not Merith.
sometimes that can make all the difference there are witches who have a very good handle on their power we call them elders out of respect so when I left one of them elder Mara gave me cinder here that
For exactly these circumstances.
I'm not a thing.
You're a construction of magic.
Pecks at you.
It kind of hurts.
Was that magical feeling to you?
Don't make me kick you.
She warned me.
If I encountered a deep witch who had gone too far to first hide, if that's not possible, run.
If that's not possible, then try not to die.

[SPEAKER_01]
That one would have been right.

[SPEAKER_03]
Sorry, the bird's probably getting too annoyed.
Do you push the bird away?
Yeah, I'm gonna shush it.
Shush it?
That's fair.
Just shush the bird if it gets too much.
The bird seems to understand that.
You just...

[SPEAKER_02]
Regardless, we are deep in the ruins.
We need to find a way out.

[SPEAKER_00]
Yes.
And perhaps...
Something is still a value down here, but he's not a giant centipede lady a weapon or two for you would be the likeliest candidate So with this short rest we can actually take a short rest heal up and like yeah It's Unless we're gonna stay another night.

[SPEAKER_02]
I think it's a good time to wrap up.

[SPEAKER_03]
Oh, yes
No, I want to get back to my mom.
So I don't think we're going to stay another night.
How was this fight?

[SPEAKER_02]
This was tough.
It was good, though.

[SPEAKER_03]
This was, I think, a good depiction of that horror movie scenario of running into a deep witch gone wrong.
I think you nailed that.
I do think we next convene, we could use a
a combat encounter that we can actually fight.
Yeah, because we haven't done a lot of that recently.
That way Jeff can...Vasgar can get to stretch his muscles.

[SPEAKER_02]
I feel like we got to use a lot of our tools, but other than not using fighting stuff, Jeff did get to use a lot of stuff, but didn't get to do the thing that fighters do as much.
But you made really good use of your action economy.

[SPEAKER_00]
I got to use a lot of action economy.
I think...
At the end of the short rest, Bazgard goes through some stretches, gets himself ready, and goes, all right, let's go.
Because Bazgard is back to full health and has all those resources back.

[SPEAKER_03]
Yay, fighting.
I figured we had three fights.
You did fight.
You didn't fight the spider.
We didn't fight the spider.
You did fight the goblins.
We did, yes.
And I thought you had a fight before that.

[SPEAKER_00]
The skeletons.

[SPEAKER_02]
We fought the skeletons.
We fought the goblins.
We didn't fight the spider.
This is more of like a skill challenge.

[SPEAKER_03]
And then this one was a skill challenge.
I didn't know how... No, this is the right way to run this.

[SPEAKER_01]
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]
In order to get this.
Okay, but good.
So the next thing just needs to be more of the fighting stuff.
So you guys can fight out of the ruins.
Hope the crow's not too annoying.
No, no.
I think this will...
It'll be good in the fact that you will have a...
a voice to speak up when you want to.
But I think the right call with it is to have the Crow, have Cinder speak up at times where it matters.
Yeah.
And not like a constant running commentary.
That's what I want to do.
Yeah.
It was only because the Crow was, I just kind of like made a mention of, the Crow will be a good talkative now.
But yes, he's not going to be,
Am I hanging on to these or are you hanging on to them?
Do you want to hang on to them?
I've been using them every time I've done this.

[SPEAKER_02]
Even now that... Oh, sorry.
Oh, no, it's okay.
The basic mini stuff you're free to keep.
I'll take the map back.

[SPEAKER_03]
If you don't want the clutter, I can take the mini stuff.

[SPEAKER_02]
Yeah.
It's up to you.

[SPEAKER_03]
I don't care.
You can leave them here.
Okay.
I'll put them in a box.
I'll probably do that.
Can I keep this?
Yeah, of course.
I think this is cool.
Yeah.
Did you draw this or did you generate it?
I generated it.
Okay.
I gave it a list of instructions.
So, but yes, it was generated to be black and white and then printed in nice paper.
When are we next going to play?
Up to you guys.
You can figure it out when you're gone or when you're driving back.
I do start work next week.

[SPEAKER_02]
What type of consistency are you looking for?
Do you want to run weekly, bi-weekly, once a month?

[SPEAKER_03]
Weekly is fine.
Bi-weekly is fine.
Once a month is fine.
They're all fine.
If we do weekly, we'll probably be doing it over Zoom.
Yeah, I figure most of it would be over Discord or Zoom or whatever.
Roll 20.
