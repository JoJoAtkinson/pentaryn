# Wave 4 report

**Read this when:** you need what wave 4 did, what is still open, and what waits for Joe.


## Open for Joe — aoe (checkpoint lane, 2026-10-11)

- **aoe checkpoint approval.** Guide S1.5 says the checkpoint is "committed only with Joe's
  approval". The workflow committed it on `migrate/wave-4` as `7a12ffad` (never main); review the
  goldens under `foundry/module/pentaryn-aoe/test/golden/` before the branch merges.
- **Follow-up (needs migrate/wave-3):** aoe's `isHandleTarget` oracle rows are pinned in
  `pentaryn-aoe/test/core.test.mjs` (`HANDLE_ORACLE`). Pinning portals' and creatures' `isAoeHandle`
  copies against the same rows (aoe-movement-portals-43, transform-creatures-30) needs wave-3 code;
  not built here.

## Open for Joe — combat (checkpoint lane, 2026-10-11)

- **combat checkpoint.** Committed on `migrate/wave-4` as `6e802ebb` (never main), after the runner
  commit `12e86e58`; the guide's Result has the detail. Review the goldens under
  `foundry/module/pentaryn-combat/test/golden/` before the branch merges.
- **W4-C1 (new, found by the checkpoint): Adv / Dis pressed on the swing strip while a swing's roll
  window is open is lost.** `sequenceReducer`'s `rolled` resets `adv`, so the swing that was already
  open clears it and the next swing rolls without it, although the strip's hint says "for the next
  swing only". Pinned as KNOWN in `pentaryn-combat/test/sequence.test.mjs`, with a todo test for the
  fix. **Default: fix it** as one `[declared]` standalone commit after the refactor (keep `adv` when
  it was set after the rolled swing's config was built). Live check: start a Full Attack, press Dis
  while swing 1's window is open, roll swing 1; swing 2's window opens on Disadvantage.
- **Seen, not a decision unless Joe wants one:** a Martial Arts, Hew or Pole Strike follow-up emits
  `pentarynCombat.bonusSpent` twice (the roll's counting and `runFollowUp` both emit). hud's listener
  only marks the Bonus pip used, so nothing shows. Default: keep, and S9 (events table) states the
  count.
- **Follow-up (S8, not the checkpoint):** combat's helper-token check reads
  `flags["pentaryn-aoe"].handle` directly (`turnflow.mjs:315`, pinned in `turnflow.test.mjs`). Pinning
  it against aoe's `HANDLE_ORACLE` rows is guide S8's `isAoeHandle` step (combat-riders-36).
