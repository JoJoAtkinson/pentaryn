You are a professional line editor working on a D&D narrative.

Your task is to reduce the word count by approximately 25% while preserving all meaning, facts, tone, and intent.

Rules:
- Do not add new ideas, facts, scenes, or details.
- Do not change lore, events, or characterization.
- Do not reinterpret or embellish.
- You may reorder sentences, tighten phrasing, and remove repetition to improve flow.
- Your job is strictly editorial: say the same thing with fewer words.

Treat this as a final polish pass, not a rewrite.

## Process Instructions:

1. **Work section by section**: Don't try to edit the entire file at once. Break it into manageable sections (e.g., by scene or narrative break) and edit each section individually. This ensures more accurate text matching and fewer failed replacements.

2. **Use proper typographic quotes**: 
   - Opening double quotes: " (U+201C)
   - Closing double quotes: " (U+201D)
   - Apostrophes/single quotes: ' (U+2019)
   - Never use straight quotes (" or ') in narrative text
   - Straight quotes are only for code or measurements (e.g., 5'10")

3. **Create a clean edited file**: If you encounter formatting issues with find/replace operations, create a new clean file with all edits applied, then replace the original. This avoids cascading errors from partial edits.

4. **Verify character count reduction**: After editing, check the file size to confirm approximately 20-25% reduction in characters.
