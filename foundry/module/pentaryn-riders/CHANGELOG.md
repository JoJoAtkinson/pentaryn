# Changelog — pentaryn-riders

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-19 (feedback EBGqNA: prepared spells first)

- New feature `spell-view.mjs`: the character sheet's Spells tab opens on the spells the character
  can cast today (prepared, always prepared, cantrips, at-will, innate, pact, cast from an item),
  through dnd5e 6's `dnd5e.filterItem` hook (no wrap). A **Show: Prepared (n) · All spells (n)**
  switch sits above the spell search with "n unprepared hidden"; a click re-applies dnd5e's list
  filters in place. The choice is a user flag per character, `flags.pentaryn-riders.spellView.<actorId>`.
  No switch when nothing would be hidden. Setting `spellView` (world, on) turns it off.
- Pure `core/spell-view.mjs` (`SPELL_VIEWS`, `inPreparedView`, `spellViewCounts`, `spellViewOf`),
  re-exported by the riders-core barrel (so also on `api.core`); adapter `spellViewInfo` in `shapes.mjs`.
- dnd5e's own filter-menu "Prepared" was not enough: it keeps `canPrepare && prepared` only, which
  hides never-ticked cantrips, at-will / innate spells and spells cast from an item.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-12 (addon blueprint migration, wave 4; released by the Wave 7 restart batch)

- Wave 7 batch: `module.json` `flags.pentaryn` blueprint keys (`flagScope` `riders` →
  `pentaryn-riders`, metadata only), `recommends` enhancedcombathud and enhancedcombathud-dnd5e,
  `styles/riders.css` (moved), `verified: "14.369"`. D7: the kit's `lib/argon-tooltip.css` is
  vendored and listed in `styles` (inert for riders alone); the `#tooltip` click-through rule stays in
  `styles/riders.css` (W4-R9).

- Rebuilt to the addon blueprint: `riders.mjs` is wiring only; nine features (`rituals`,
  `concentration`, `argon-tidy`, `cast-flow`, `damage-riders`, `card-note`, `tray-preset`,
  `battle-medic`, `hd-sheet`) install in the old hook order; `settings.mjs`, `api-manifest.mjs`,
  `api.mjs`, the adapters `shapes.mjs` and `argon.mjs`, `patches.mjs`, and the vendored kit (`lib/`).
- The six hand patches go through the kit's `wrapMethod`, one marker each, listed by
  `describe().patches` and undone by `uninstall()`.
- API: built from the manifest and frozen; new `inspect(ref, { as })`, `selftest()`,
  `arcaneRecovery(ref)`, `describe()`, `settings()`, `trace()`, `uninstall()`, `version`,
  `contract`. The legacy members answer as before, and their actor argument now also takes a
  name, id, UUID or Token (a miss answers `null`).
- Published with the kit's `publishNamespace`, synchronously at `ready`; `module.api` is set and
  `pentaryn-riders.ready` fires. A frozen `game.pentaryn` now throws instead of being replaced.
- The Battle Medic relay goes through the kit's `guarded` (`sender: "any"`): a query reaching a
  non-GM client answers `NOT_GM: this client is not a GM`. It logs an audit line per success and a
  warn per refusal. The runner sends a request id and the GM tabs claim it first, so two GM tabs
  heal once, even when one tab's claim lands after the other recorded its result (combat-riders-41).
  Recording a result no longer prunes another patient request that is still being claimed
  (`794e1ed9`), so two Battle Medics on one patient at once also heal once each.
- Three silent catches now log at debug (`CONFIG.debug["pentaryn-riders"] = true`).
- The once-per-casting guard reads the usage card's own messages from dnd5e's message registry
  (`dnd5e.registry.messages`) instead of scanning the whole chat log on each attack damage roll;
  it scans the log as before when the registry is missing.
- Pure kernels for Hit Dice pools, the Battle Medic gate and the report row (`core/hit-dice.mjs`);
  one spell-slot builder (`slotsFrom`).

## 0.2.0

- dnd5e 6 build; the usability re-runs' Ritual Adept, Longer casts, concentration, cast-flow and
  Argon tidy-ups.

## 0.1.0

- dnd5e 5.3 build: Elemental Adept, Elemental Affinity, Potent Spellcasting, Healer, Battle Medic,
  the sheet's Hit Dice − / +.
