# AGENTS.md

This repo is a D&D 5.5e campaign vault. When you create or edit content, follow these rules.

## Golden rules
- Preserve existing lore and tone; do not retcon unless asked.
- Prefer small, focused changes. Keep files readable and linkable.
- Use relative links between docs.

## Where things go (high level)
- Naming Conventions: world/naming_conventions/primary-factions.md
- Characters: /characters/player-characters, /characters/npcs
- World: /world/factions, /world/history, /world/lore
- Sessions: /sessions/notes (new), /sessions/planning (upcoming), /sessions/archive (old)
- Quests: /quests/active, /quests/completed, /quests/side-quests
- Items: /items/magic-items, /items/artifacts, /items/mundane
- Creatures: /creatures/monsters, /creatures/bestiary, /creatures/custom
- Rules: /rules/house-rules, /rules/references, /rules/mechanics
- Templates: /templates

## Factions and locations layout
- Factions live in folders: `world/factions/<faction-slug>/_overview.md`
- Locations live under their region/faction: `world/factions/<region-slug>/locations/<location>.md`
- Avoid creating `world/locations/` (locations are tracked inside the relevant faction folder)

## Naming and formatting
- Filenames: kebab-case (e.g., location-name.md).
- Sessions: session-XX-YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Markdown: use # / ## / ###, bullets for lists, tables for stat blocks, > for read-aloud.

## Metadata
- Include front matter when creating new lore docs:
  - created date, last modified, tags, status

## World naming conventions
- For complex names, include pronunciation on first mention:
  Name (PHONETIC) with CAPS for stressed syllables.

## If Copilot instructions exist
- Also follow .github/copilot-instructions.md for the full style guide.
