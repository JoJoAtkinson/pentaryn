Drip, drip, drip—
the candle’s burning thin.
Shorter now,
the wick grows dim.

When it gutters,
the elf will fall.

Daddy waits beyond the dark,
Daddy wakes you with a spark.
Counts your breaths—
each one known,
just like all the others gone.

Drip, drip, drip—
the candle shrinks.
Drip, drip, drip—
the last light blinks.

Drip, drip, drip—
no wax remains,
no warmth, no pain.

Silence.

Then you wake—
not breath, but sight.
Not warmth, but truth.
Not fear, but weight.

Daddy smiles.
The dark stands still.

Drip, drip, drip—
a candle blooms.

Drip, drip, drip—
the candle flickers once more

Drip, drip, drip—
