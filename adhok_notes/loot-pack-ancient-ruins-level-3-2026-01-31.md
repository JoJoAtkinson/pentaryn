# Loot Pack — Ancient Ruins (Level 3) — 2026-01-31

Full backpack of mixed loot (some coin, some trade goods, some lightly magical). Ordered from **most interesting** to **least**.

1. **Prism-Silt Lens** (uncommon) — palm-sized cracked crystal; when held to the eye, you can see faint “old-magic seams” (invisible sigils, ward lines, illusion edges) within 30 ft. for 10 minutes, 1/day.
2. **Thread-Silver Coil** (uncommon) — 60 ft silk-metal cord; advantage on one Athletics/Acrobatics check to climb/secure per short rest; counts as silk rope and won’t rot.
3. **Cistern-Keeper’s Keytag** (uncommon) — a stamped metal tag on a chain; 1/day you can cast *knock* **only** on ancient/ruins mechanisms (doors, ports, vault wheels), but it rings like grinding stone.
4. **Lantern of Pale Moths** (uncommon) — hooded lantern; light is normal, but 1/day you can cause it to reveal invisible **objects** (not creatures) within 10 ft for 1 minute.
5. **Stone-Quiet Boots** (uncommon) — while not in heavy armor, 1/day for 10 minutes your footsteps make no sound (not invisibility; just silence of steps).
6. **Eel-Skin Map Tube** (common) — waterproof tube with a self-sealing cap; any paper inside stays dry even submerged.
7. **Old-World Chalk** (common, 6 sticks) — writing glows faintly in darkness; markings last 24 hours and can’t be smeared by water.
8. **Shard-Glass Marbles** (common, 12) — thrown as an object; create a 5‑ft slick scatter of razor glass until start of your next turn (treat as difficult terrain; DM adjudicates).
9. **Salt-Needle Pearls** (trade goods) — pouch with 14 jagged pearls (surgical/craft); worth **70 gp** total.
10. **Brine-Glass Sand** (trade goods) — small jar; abrasive for lenses/metal; worth **25 gp**.
11. **Crumbling Ward-Tile** (common) — fist-sized etched ceramic; once, when you would take damage, it reduces that damage by **1d6** and shatters.
12. **Vial of “Bluewake”** (common, 2 vials) — bitter tonic; as a bonus action, gain advantage on one save vs poison/disease in the next minute.
13. **Spider-Silk Wrap** (common, 2 rolls) — bandage/cloth; grants advantage on one Medicine check to stabilize per roll (consumed on use).
14. **Rune-Stamped Hinge** (odd salvage) — looks valuable to collectors/artificers; worth **15 gp**.
15. **Half-Full Coinspider Purse** (coins) — **23 gp, 41 sp, 60 cp** in mixed, stained coin.
16. **Broken Wand Core** (salvage) — inert; useful as arcane focus components; worth **10 gp**.
17. **Glowcap Jerky** (rations) — 6 days of trail food; faintly luminescent for an hour after opening (no mechanical benefit).
18. **Iron Pitons** (gear) — 10 pitons + small hammer.
19. **Underleaf Oilcloth** (gear) — waterproof sheet/poncho.
20. **Tarnished Ring with Ancient Mark** (trinket) — nonmagical, but distinctive; worth **5 gp** to the right buyer (or a hook).
