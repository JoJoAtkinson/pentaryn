# The Inkbound Charter

> A ruin crew with paperwork: they map, measure, and invoice the darkness.

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party Slug** | `inkbound-charter` |
| **Alignment / Ethos** | Lawful Neutral |
| **Personality Type** | Professionals (process-driven, cautious, detail-obsessed) |
| **Level Range** | 2–4 |
| **Home Base** | [Ardenford](../../factions/ardenhaven/locations/ardenford/ardenford.md) |
| **Primary Target** | [Western Scrubland Ruins](../../factions/ardenhaven/locations/ruins-western-scrubland.md) (survey + salvage) |
| **Loot Policy** | Signed shares, receipts, and a locked “finds box” until appraisal |
| **Rulebook** | [Party & Member Creation Rules](../_party-creation-rules.md) |

## Why They Delve

They’re here for profit, but not chaos: document finds, sell through legal channels, and build a reputation that leads to bigger contracts. If the ruins become a long-term dig site, they want their names on the paperwork first.

## Why They Stay Together

- The charter is enforceable: quitters forfeit shares and gear deposits.
- Their notary keeps everyone honest, and their fighter keeps everyone alive.
- They don’t compete internally for shiny objects—everything gets logged first.

## Roster

| Name | Ancestry | Origin | Class | Level | Alignment | Background | Party Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| Edric Holt | Human | [Ardenhaven](../../factions/ardenhaven/_overview.md) | Ranger | 3 | Lawful Neutral | City warden | Captain / scout | Treats delving like patrol work |
| Lysa Quill | Human | [Ardenhaven](../../factions/ardenhaven/_overview.md) | Bard | 2 | Lawful Neutral | Notary | Face / record-keeper | The receipts are *her* weapon |
| Kelda Thrumbar | Dwarf | [Dulgarum](../../factions/dulgarum-oathholds/_overview.md) | Fighter | 4 | Lawful Neutral | Oathbound guard | Security / carry | Doesn’t joke. Doesn’t need to. |
| Suri Copperpin | Gnome | [Merrowgate](../../factions/merrowgate/_overview.md) | Wizard | 2 | True Neutral | Map-scrivener | Survey / arcana | Lives for measurements and margins |
| Toby Redwick | Human | [Ardenhaven](../../factions/ardenhaven/_overview.md) | Rogue | 2 | Chaotic Neutral | Farmhand-turned-burglar | Locks / “creative entry” | **Wild card:** hates rules, loves payouts |

### Exceptions & Notes

- Toby’s on the charter because *someone* has to open doors; everyone pretends not to see how he does it.
