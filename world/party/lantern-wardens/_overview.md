# The Lantern Wardens

> Delvers with a conscience: a lantern, a rope, a plan—and a vow to bring people back.

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party Slug** | `lantern-wardens` |
| **Alignment / Ethos** | Neutral Good |
| **Personality Type** | Caretakers (service-first, risk-aware) |
| **Level Range** | 2–4 |
| **Home Base** | [Ardenford](../../factions/ardenhaven/locations/ardenford/ardenford.md) |
| **Primary Target** | [Western Scrubland Ruins](../../factions/ardenhaven/locations/ruins-western-scrubland.md) and nearby foundations |
| **Loot Policy** | Equal shares; 10% “lantern tithe” for rope/lamps/medkits; no cursed-item sales to civilians |
| **Rulebook** | [Party & Member Creation Rules](../_party-creation-rules.md) |

## Why They Delve

They want coin like anyone else, but their pitch is *public safety*: clear hazards, map entrances, recover valuables, and keep desperate locals from dying in holes. The “lantern tithe” funds supplies and quiet payments to families when a delver doesn’t come back.

## Why They Stay Together

- They drafted a simple vow: *no one goes in alone; no one gets left in the dark.*
- Each member has a stake in the others’ survival: shared gear, shared routes, shared liability.
- Their leader has the local trust to get jobs; their arcane scholar keeps them alive in places steel can’t help.
