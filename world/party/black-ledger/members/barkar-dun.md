# Grek Bar'Kar (GREK bar-KAR)

> “It’s not evil. It’s engineering.”

## Snapshot

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party** | [The Black Ledger](../_overview.md) |
| **Ancestry** | Dwarf |
| **Origin** | [Garhammar](../../../factions/garhammar-trade-league/_overview.md) |
| **Class / Level** | Artificer 2 |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Neutral |
| **Background** | Guild engineer |
| **Party Role** | Wards / tools |

## Public Profile

- Talks like a foreman: short sentences, measured anger, constant assessment.
- Keeps his gear spotless; his hands are always nicked from fine work.
- The only one who looks uneasy when the Ledger “collects.”

## Mechanics (Level 2 Artificer)

*Baseline:* written to be quick at the table, using a “standard 5e Artificer” assumption (Tasha-style). If your campaign is using a different Artificer write-up, treat this as a scaffold and we’ll swap specifics.

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| **Proficiency Bonus** | +2 |
| **Hit Dice** | 2d8 |
| **Spellcasting Ability** | Intelligence |
| **Spell Save DC** | 8 + PB (+2) + INT mod |
| **Spell Attack** | PB (+2) + INT mod |
| **Spell Slots** | 2× 1st-level |
| **Cantrips Known** | 2 |
| **Prepared Spells** | INT mod + 1 |

### Class Features (quick list)

- **Magical Tinkering:** minor gadget-magic on a tiny object (marking, light, sound, recorded message, odor, etc.).
- **Spellcasting:** prepares spells from the artificer list; uses tools as casting focus.
- **Infuse Item:** knows 4 infusions; can have 2 infused items active at once.

### Infusions (suggested, “wards/tools”)

**Known (4):**
- **Enhanced Defense** (armor/shield)
- **Mind Sharpener** (armor; helps keep concentration)
- **Repeating Shot** (crossbow/firearm, if you use those rules)
- **Replicate Magic Item** (pick one: *Bag of Holding* is the most universally useful)

**Active (2):**
- Enhanced Defense on his armor/shield
- Replicate Magic Item (Bag of Holding) on his pack

### Spells (suggested loadout)

**Cantrips:** *mending*, *guidance*.

**Prepared (INT mod + 1):** pick from practical worksite magic like *detect magic*, *cure wounds*, *faerie fire*, *alarm*, *sanctuary* (exact list depends on which artificer list you’re using at your table).

## Methods

- Builds quick wards and rigged tools that make bad choices survivable.
- Prefers prevention: wedges, lines, chalk-marks, and redundant failsafes.
- Treats every ruin like a collapsing worksite, not a battlefield.

## Leverage & Tells

- **Debt-trap:** his guild contract can repossess his work, his tools, and his name—Vessa keeps a copy.
- He hates cruelty, but he hates bankruptcy more.
- When he lies, he over-explains the mechanics.

## Hooks

- Quietly slips a PC a warning about a trap the Ledger plans to “let happen.”
- Offers a repair at cost… then asks for help clearing a debt clause he can’t afford to fight alone.
- Is the easiest member to flip: not by mercy, but by a better contract.
