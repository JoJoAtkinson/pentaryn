# Vessa Kain

> “Sign, then bleed. In that order.”

## Snapshot

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party** | [The Black Ledger](../_overview.md) |
| **Ancestry** | Human |
| **Origin** | [Merrowgate](../../../factions/merrowgate/_overview.md) |

| **Background** | Guild fixer |
| **Party Role** | Boss / planner |

## Class Build (Rogue 4)

> “A deal doesn’t close until you can disappear with the ledger and the witness.”

- **Expertise:** Doubles proficiency in Investigation and Persuasion, turning her “terms” into actionable evidence and giving her the charm to close the ledger’s sales.
- **Sneak Attack (2d6):** Built for the rapier/hand crossbow dance—if she can tease out advantage, or keep a teammate opposite a mark, the “pen” cut hits like a strike.
- **Thieves’ Cant & Tools:** Always has thieves’ tools, a disguise kit, and the shorthand symbols of the underworld. She reads a room and writes a warning in the same breath.
- **Cunning Action:** Bonus-action Dash/Disengage/Hide every turn keeps her three steps ahead of angry debtors or lawmen.
- **Roguish Archetype — Thief:** Fast Hands, Second-Story Work, and future Supreme Sneak all reinforce her fixer reputation—she can “adjust” settlements without breaking stride and vanish before the mess shows up.
- **Ability Score Improvement:** Split between Dexterity and Charisma to keep her movement precise and her words persuasive.
- **Tactics:** Let others open the fight; she stays in the mess, exploits flanking, then vanishes, keeping witnesses useful rather than dead.

### Notes

- She uses Sneak Attack support from Orren/Zor’gar; keep her in cover and out of direct charge.

## Public Profile

- Always calm. Always “reasonable.” Always taking notes.
- Dresses like a clerk, moves like a knife.
- Speaks in *terms*: obligations, defaults, penalties, collateral.

## Methods

- Uses written contracts to make violence feel “official.”
- Prefers leverage over blood, but keeps an exit route for both.
- Keeps multiple identities for Ardenford work: a “broker,” a “scribe,” and a “client.”

## Leverage & Tells

- Carries a small book of pre-written clauses; she only changes names and numbers.
- If the deal gets messy, she offers a path to compliance before she offers a threat.
- Her strongest fear is *uncontrolled loss*: fire, panic, and anything that can’t be accounted for.

## Hooks

- Offers the party a clean cut on a ruin… with a clause that makes them the “liable subcontractor.”
- Sells information about a competitor’s route—then sells the competitor the party’s name.
- “Accidentally” leaves a page of the ledger where a curious PC will find it.
