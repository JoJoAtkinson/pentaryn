## Public Profile

- Always calm. Always “reasonable.” Always taking notes.
- Dresses like a clerk, moves like a knife.
- Speaks in *terms*: obligations, defaults, penalties, collateral.

## Methods

- Uses written contracts to make violence feel “official.”
- Prefers leverage over blood, but keeps an exit route for both.
- Keeps multiple identities for Ardenford work: a “broker,” a “scribe,” and a “client.”

## Leverage & Tells

- Carries a small book of pre-written clauses; she only changes names and numbers.
- If the deal gets messy, she offers a path to compliance before she offers a threat.
- Her strongest fear is *uncontrolled loss*: fire, panic, and anything that can’t be accounted for.

## Hooks

- Offers the party a clean cut on a ruin… with a clause that makes them the “liable subcontractor.”
- Sells information about a competitor’s route—then sells the competitor the party’s name.
- “Accidentally” leaves a page of the ledger where a curious PC will find it.
