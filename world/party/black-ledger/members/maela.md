## Spellwork (Warlock 3)

> *Her magic is paperwork with teeth.*

| Spellcasting | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Ability** | Charisma |
| **Spell save DC** | `8 + proficiency bonus + CHA mod` |
| **Spell attack** | `proficiency bonus + CHA mod` |
| **Pact slots** | `2` slots (cast at **2nd level**) |
| **Typical tells** | Blackened ink under the nails; whispered clauses; a sigil written, then blotted |

-- 2 level spell of a favor 

### Cantrips (at-will)

- **Eldritch Blast** — her “collection notice.”
- **Minor Illusion** — false omens, forged “signs,” and misdirection.
  - Hits with force energy (1 beam at level 1, 2 at 5th, 3 at 11th, 4 at 17th); each beam makes its own ranged spell attack (120 ft) for 1d10 force damage. Agonizing Blast adds Cha to each beam if she ever takes it.
  - Minor Illusion can create either a sound or an image (not both) within 30 ft; it lasts 1 minute and doesn’t require concentration, perfect for fake ledger notes or a rumbling warning.

### Spells known (pick 4; cast using pact slots)

- **Armor of Agathys** — punishment for anyone who grabs what isn’t theirs.
- **Hex** — the debt becomes a weakness.
- **Invisibility** — leave before the conversation turns violent.
- **Suggestion** — contracts, gently enforced.
  - Armor of Agathys is a 1st-level self-only spell (1 action, 1 hour duration) that grants 5 temporary hit points and deals 5 cold damage to any creature that hits her with a melee attack while the temp HP remain (scales +5 per higher slot).
  - Hex (1st-level, bonus action, concentration up to 1 hour) curses a target for 1d6 necrotic extra damage on every hit and gives disadvantage on ability checks of a chosen ability; the curse can jump to a new target with a bonus action if the first drops to 0 HP.
  - Invisibility (2nd-level, 1 action, concentration up to 1 hour) makes a creature she touches invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, letting Maela slip away or rearrange the scene without being seen.
  - Suggestion (2nd-level, 1 action, concentration up to 8 hours) forces a creature that fails a Wisdom save to follow a reasonable-sounding command (e.g., “leave this room,” “hand over the ledger”) for the duration.

### Optional swaps (if you want her sharper in a given scene)

- **Charm Person** (social leverage)
- **Disguise Self** (identity as a commodity)
- **Hellish Rebuke** (the moment someone “breaks terms”)
- **Darkness** (covering an exit or isolating a mark)
- **Mirror Image** (survive the consequences)

## Combat Stats

> HP, saves, and proficiencies assume average rolls for a Warlock 3 with the following mental focus and defenses.

| Trait | Value |
|---|---|
| **HP** | `24` (3d8; 8 + 2 × (avg. 5 + 2) with Con 14) |
| **Hit Dice** | 3d8 |
| **AC** | `13` (Mage Armor, Dex 12) |
| **Speed** | 30 ft |
| **Ability mods** | Str 8 (−1), Dex 12 (+1), Con 14 (+2), Int 13 (+1), Wis 10 (+0), Cha 16 (+3) |
| **Saving Throws** | Wisdom +2 (Proficiency + Wisdom), Charisma +5 |
| **Skills / Tools** | Arcana +3, Deception +5, Insight +2, Investigation +3 |
| **Spellcasting** | Spell save DC 13, Spell attack +5 (CHA-based) |
| **Equipment** | Quarterstaff (focus), dagger, components pouch, scroll of minor runes |

### Notes

- Mage Armor keeps her nimble; Mark the Charisma bonus when she threatens curses.
- A failed wrath–style strike still leaves her resistances intact (no rage, so no resistances).

## Public Profile

- Smiles too politely when someone mentions “blessings.”
- Smells faintly of smoke and dried herbs; her fingertips are stained dark.
- Treats taboo knowledge like inventory: sorted, priced, and ready to move.

## Methods

- Identifies what a relic *does*, what it *costs*, and who will pay to take the cost.
- Uses fear as a tool—quietly, surgically—never wasting it.
- Keeps a charm for every job and a clause for every charm.

## Leverage & Tells

- She never says her patron’s name out loud; she writes it and then blots the ink.
- She is fast to sell cursed items to the “right” buyer, slow to destroy anything.
- When she’s worried, she counts under her breath.

## Hooks

- Offers to “lift” a curse from a PC—for a favor that becomes a debt.
- Knows a black-market buyer who pays extra for relics that still bite.
- Recognizes an omen in the ruins and pushes the party toward the most profitable danger.
