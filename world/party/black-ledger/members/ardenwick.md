## Snapshot

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party** | [The Black Ledger](../_overview.md) |
| **Ancestry** | Human |
| **Origin** | [Ardenhaven](../../../factions/ardenhaven/_overview.md) |
| **Class / Level** | Fighter 3 |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Evil |
| **Background** | Deserter |
| **Party Role** | Muscle / enforcer |

## Class Build (Fighter 3)

> “Keep to the plan and keep them in range.”

- **Fighting Style:** *Dueling* (bonus +2 damage when he fights with a single martial weapon and no shield, reinforcing his reputation for precise strikes rather than swinging wildly).
- **Second Wind:** Bonus action to regain `1d10 + level` HP once per short rest—he uses this when a scrape would otherwise slow the ledger’s pace.
- **Action Surge:** Once per short rest, he can take an extra action, letting him close, shove, grapple, or land a heavy finish before a mark escapes.
- **Martial Archetype:** *Champion* — favors brutal efficiency: improved crit range (19–20) and later Remarkable Athlete growth make him a walking threat and a steady guard.
- **Gear lane:** prefers a well-balanced longsword/bastard weapon for finishing blows, a light crossbow for distance, and studded armor with a reinforced cloak (adds intimidation plus cover).
- **Tactics:** positions himself to contest exits, uses Action Surge to end the fight on his terms, and keeps favor with the ledger by not taking unnecessary hits (Second Wind buys him time to keep the ledger’s ledger balanced).

## Combat Stats

> Brutal precision—these stats assume Fighter 3 with the given physical spread.

| **Hit Dice** | 3d10 |
| **AC** | `18` (Studded armor + Dueling, shield carried when he isn’t using his blade) |

| **Equipment** | Longsword (dueling), light crossbow, handaxe, shield, ledger-branded cloak |

### Notes

- Action Surge opens a second attack or shove before the enemy flees; Second Wind keeps him standing in the doorway.

## Public Profile

- Quiet, squared shoulders, eyes that don’t blink when someone lies.
- Talks little; when he does, it’s the last warning.
- Keeps watch like he’s still on a wall-walk.

## Methods

- Stands where he can block doors, corridors, and escape lines.
- Enforces “terms” with restraint: a broken hand today is a living debtor tomorrow.
- Lets Vessa talk; he finishes conversations.

## Leverage & Tells

- He avoids Ardenhaven uniforms and official seals like a superstition.
- If someone invokes “duty,” his jaw tightens before he answers.
- He’s loyal to the ledger because it’s simple: pay what you owe, or pay more.

## Hooks

- Recognizes a PC as “the kind that runs” and offers “protection” at interest.
- Takes a personal dislike to any authority figure who claims to be incorruptible.
- Offers to “settle” a debt with violence the moment the paperwork clears.
