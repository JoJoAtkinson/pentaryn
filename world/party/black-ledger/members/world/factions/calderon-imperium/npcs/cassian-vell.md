### Weapons (for your attack row)

| Weapon | Attack Bonus | Damage | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Rapier | +7 | 1d8 + 4 (piercing) | Finesse; **Sneak Attack** adds 3d6 once/turn when eligible. |
| Shortbow | +7 | 1d6 + 4 (piercing) | Range 80/320; **Sneak Attack** eligible. |
| Dagger | +7 | 1d4 + 4 (piercing) | Finesse, light, thrown 20/60. |

**Quick damage math:** On a normal Sneak Attack hit, roll weapon damage + 3d6 (rapier: `1d8 + 4 + 3d6`; shortbow: `1d6 + 4 + 3d6`). On a critical hit, double *all dice* (including Sneak Attack).

## Features to Run at the Table

- **Sneak Attack (3d6, 1/turn):** Add 3d6 damage to one hit with a finesse/ranged weapon if Cassian has advantage, *or* if an enemy of the target is within 5 ft of it and Cassian doesn’t have disadvantage.
- **Cunning Action (bonus action):** Dash, Disengage, or Hide.
- **Uncanny Dodge (reaction):** When hit by an attacker Cassian can see, halve the damage.
- **Assassinate:** Cassian has advantage against creatures that haven’t taken a turn yet in the combat. Any hit against a surprised creature is a critical hit.
- **Expertise:** Already included in skill/tool bonuses above.

## Actions

- **Rapier.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. *Hit:* 1d8 + 4 piercing damage (plus Sneak Attack if eligible).
- **Shortbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft, one target. *Hit:* 1d6 + 4 piercing damage (plus Sneak Attack if eligible).
- **Dagger.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft or range 20/60 ft, one target. *Hit:* 1d4 + 4 piercing damage (plus Sneak Attack if eligible).

## Bonus Actions

- **Cunning Action (Dash/Disengage/Hide).**

## Reactions

- **Uncanny Dodge.**

## Poison (Censorate Issue)

**Grey-ink venom (injury).** Cassian carries `3` doses. As a bonus action, he can coat one weapon or up to 3 pieces of ammunition. The coating remains for 1 minute or until it hits.

- **On hit:** target makes a **DC 12 Fortitude (Constitution) save**.
  - **Fail:** target takes **1d4 Constitution damage**.
  - **Success:** no effect.

## Tactics (fast to run)

- **Round 1:** If Cassian has cover, open with **Shortbow** from stealth; apply **Sneak Attack**. If engaged in melee, strike with **Rapier** then **Disengage** to break contact.
- **If the party clusters:** Cassian does *not* trade blows—he **Hides** and forces the PCs to spend actions finding him.
- **If pinned:** Use **Uncanny Dodge** on the biggest single hit and retreat to cover; he fights to escape, not to die for the edicts.

## Hooks / Use in the Imperium

- Carries a stamped writ that authorizes seizures, detentions, and “expedited audits.”
- Wants a clean arrest and a cleaner report; violence is paperwork he’d rather avoid.
