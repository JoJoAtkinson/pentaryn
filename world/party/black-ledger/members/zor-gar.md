## Public Profile

- Laughs at threats, respects payment, remembers insults.
- Loud on purpose: he wants people to feel him coming.
- Keeps trophies that are practical—buckles, keys, rings—not sentimental.

## Methods

- Breaks lines and doors, then dares someone to stop him.
- Prefers intimidation to killing: fear makes compliance cheaper.
- Plays the “monster” role because it keeps bargaining simple.

## Leverage & Tells

- His “oath” wasn’t sacred; it was a bargain he chose not to pay.
- He follows Vessa’s rules because they protect his share.
- He’s easy to provoke when someone calls him predictable.

## Hooks

- Picks a fight to cover the Ledger’s retreat, then charges for the “service.”
- Offers a brutal solution to a moral problem—framed as “efficiency.”
- A rival tries to buy him away mid-job; he treats it as normal negotiation.
