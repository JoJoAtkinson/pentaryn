# Zor'gar (ZOR-gar)

> “Honor doesn’t buy bandages.”

## Snapshot

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party** | [The Black Ledger](../_overview.md) |
| **Ancestry** | Orc |
| **Origin** | [Garrok](../../../factions/garrok-confederation/_overview.md) |
| **Class / Level** | Barbarian 3 |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Evil |
| **Background** | Oathbreaker |
| **Party Role** | Breach / intimidation |

## Class Build (Barbarian 3)

> “Rage settles debts quicker than a ledger ever could.”

- **Rage:** Bonus action to enter rage (3/day), granting advantage on Strength checks/Saves, resistance to bludgeoning/piercing/slashing, and bonus damage that reflects his brute-force signature. He keeps it until the target is down or he’s forced out of melee.
- **Unarmored Defense:** Wears no heavy armor—just reinforced war paint and a heavy cloak—keeping AC = 10 + Dex + Con while still brandishing a greataxe/maul.
- **Reckless Attack:** Opens attacks with advantage, trading defense for more consistent hits and maximizing the Ledger’s intimidation.
- **Danger Sense:** Advantage on visible Dex saves keeps him from getting surprised by traps or backstabs while he’s the charging force.
- **Primal Path – Berserker:** Frenzy lets him swing again with a bonus action (exhaustion after rage ends), matching his “never stop until the job is done” persona.
- **Equipment & Tactics:** Carries a maul, grenades of rending metal, and a reinforced shielded cloak separately. Charges doorways, uses Rage/ Frenzy to push through crowd control, and lets Orren clean up any precision work.

### Notes

- Reckless Attack trades defense for more chances to land a maul, especially when he activates Frenzy.

## Public Profile

- Laughs at threats, respects payment, remembers insults.
- Loud on purpose: he wants people to feel him coming.
- Keeps trophies that are practical—buckles, keys, rings—not sentimental.

## Methods

- Breaks lines and doors, then dares someone to stop him.
- Prefers intimidation to killing: fear makes compliance cheaper.
- Plays the “monster” role because it keeps bargaining simple.

## Leverage & Tells

- His “oath” wasn’t sacred; it was a bargain he chose not to pay.
- He follows Vessa’s rules because they protect his share.
- He’s easy to provoke when someone calls him predictable.

## Hooks

- Picks a fight to cover the Ledger’s retreat, then charges for the “service.”
- Offers a brutal solution to a moral problem—framed as “efficiency.”
- A rival tries to buy him away mid-job; he treats it as normal negotiation.
