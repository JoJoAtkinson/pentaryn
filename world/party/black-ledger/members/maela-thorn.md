## Public Profile

- Smiles too politely when someone mentions “blessings.”
- Smells faintly of smoke and dried herbs; her fingertips are stained dark.
- Treats taboo knowledge like inventory: sorted, priced, and ready to move.

## Methods

- Identifies what a relic *does*, what it *costs*, and who will pay to take the cost.
- Uses fear as a tool—quietly, surgically—never wasting it.
- Keeps a charm for every job and a clause for every charm.

## Leverage & Tells

- She never says her patron’s name out loud; she writes it and then blots the ink.
- She is fast to sell cursed items to the “right” buyer, slow to destroy anything.
- When she’s worried, she counts under her breath.

## Hooks

- Offers to “lift” a curse from a PC—for a favor that becomes a debt.
- Knows a black-market buyer who pays extra for relics that still bite.
- Recognizes an omen in the ruins and pushes the party toward the most profitable danger.
