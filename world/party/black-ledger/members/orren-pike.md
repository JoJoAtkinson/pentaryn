## Public Profile

- Quiet, squared shoulders, eyes that don’t blink when someone lies.
- Talks little; when he does, it’s the last warning.
- Keeps watch like he’s still on a wall-walk.

## Methods

- Stands where he can block doors, corridors, and escape lines.
- Enforces “terms” with restraint: a broken hand today is a living debtor tomorrow.
- Lets Vessa talk; he finishes conversations.

## Leverage & Tells

- He avoids Ardenhaven uniforms and official seals like a superstition.
- If someone invokes “duty,” his jaw tightens before he answers.
- He’s loyal to the ledger because it’s simple: pay what you owe, or pay more.

## Hooks

- Recognizes a PC as “the kind that runs” and offers “protection” at interest.
- Takes a personal dislike to any authority figure who claims to be incorruptible.
- Offers to “settle” a debt with violence the moment the paperwork clears.
