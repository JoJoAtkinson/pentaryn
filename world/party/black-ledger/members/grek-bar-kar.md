# Grek Bar'Kar (GREK bar-KAR)

> “It’s not evil. It’s engineering.”

## Snapshot

## Public Profile

- Talks like a foreman: short sentences, measured anger, constant assessment.
- Keeps his gear spotless; his hands are always nicked from fine work.
- The only one who looks uneasy when the Ledger “collects.”

## Methods

- Builds quick wards and rigged tools that make bad choices survivable.
- Prefers prevention: wedges, lines, chalk-marks, and redundant failsafes.
- Treats every ruin like a collapsing worksite, not a battlefield.

## Leverage & Tells

- **Debt-trap:** his guild contract can repossess his work, his tools, and his name—Vessa keeps a copy.
- He hates cruelty, but he hates bankruptcy more.
- When he lies, he over-explains the mechanics.

## Hooks

- Quietly slips a PC a warning about a trap the Ledger plans to “let happen.”
- Offers a repair at cost… then asks for help clearing a debt clause he can’t afford to fight alone.
- Is the easiest member to flip: not by mercy, but by a better contract.
