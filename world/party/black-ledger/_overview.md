## Why They Delve

Money is the point. They’re built to turn artifacts into coin fast: appraise, extract, fence. If something is cursed, they don’t destroy it—they find a buyer who can’t complain.

## Why They Stay Together

- Their contracts are real, witnessed, and *punitive*—breaking terms costs more than a delver can pay.
- Each member is complicit in at least one crime the others can prove.
- The crew moves like a machine: faster than “honest” parties, because they don’t stop to help.


### Exceptions & Notes

- Barkar-dun stays because leaving means the guild repossesses everything he owns—and Merrowlyn knows where he sleeps.
