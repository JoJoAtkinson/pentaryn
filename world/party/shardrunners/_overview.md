# The Shardrunners

> Fast feet, faster mouths: they live for the story—until the story tries to kill them.

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Party Slug** | `shardrunners` |
| **Alignment / Ethos** | Chaotic Neutral |
| **Personality Type** | Thrill-seekers (impulsive, rumor-chasing, high variance) |
| **Level Range** | 2–4 |
| **Home Base** | [Ardenford](../../factions/ardenhaven/locations/ardenford/ardenford.md) |
| **Primary Target** | “The next score” (currently sniffing around the [Western Scrubland Ruins](../../factions/ardenhaven/locations/ruins-western-scrubland.md)) |
| **Loot Policy** | Winner’s choice in the moment, then equal split after appraisal (arguments expected) |
| **Rulebook** | [Party & Member Creation Rules](../_party-creation-rules.md) |

## Why They Delve

They want money, but they want the *hit* too: the rush of a sealed door, the snap of a trap, the moment you see something no one else has seen. Most of them are also in debt. The ruins are the only bet big enough to matter.

## Why They Stay Together

- They owe money to the same people. Separately, they’re easy to collect from. Together, they’re harder to corner.
- Their gnome bankrolls gear and bribes—everyone else pays him back out of the “real haul.”
- Their healer keeps them alive; their spirit-walker keeps them from walking into the wrong kind of dark.

### Exceptions & Notes

- **Rare origin:** Ug'nak is Rakthoki. Politics and paranoia make her presence unusual; she claims a vision forced her west.
