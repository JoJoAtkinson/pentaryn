## Big Picture

**Four Living Powers:** Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs shape the world's politics and control its largest territories. These four races dominate trade, diplomacy, and warfare.

**The Fifth Power is Dead—But Not Gone:** A long-fallen ancient empire once ruled vast lands. Though its people are gone and its cities lie in ruins, their magic lingers. Artifacts, wards, and ancient workings still pulse with power in forgotten places. If someone were to master even a fraction of what remains, they could reshape—or destroy—the world. The ruins are both treasure and threat, and everyone knows it.

**But the World is Diverse:** Halflings, gnomes, tieflings, dragonborn, and countless other peoples live throughout the lands. Some thrive in the great cities as merchants, artisans, and citizens. Others maintain their own towns, villages, and communities—some hidden, some remote, some openly trading with the major powers. You'll find all kinds of folk on the road, in taverns, and standing beside you when trouble comes calling.

**No Matter Your Heritage:** Whether you were raised in a human kingdom, a dwarven hold, an elven sanctuary, an orc confederation—or in a halfling river village, a gnomish workshop district, a tiefling quarter, or a dragonborn merchant clan—there's a place for you in this world. Your story matters as much as any lord's or emperor's.
