# World Factions Overview

High-level index of major factions across cultures. Each entry links to a future dedicated document.

## 🧝‍♀️ Elves

### 1) Araethilion (AR-ay-THIL-ee-on) — Veiled Crown Theocracy
- People: Elves
- Theme: False divinity, beautiful tyranny, prosperity built on hidden suffering
- Government: Theocratic Autocracy under a “living god” and high priestly court
- Background: An “immortal” ruler is worshipped as a god who blesses forests, harvests, and arts. In truth, agelessness and prosperity are sustained by siphoning tiny amounts of life-force from every elf. Seers and dissidents fear ending the rite could free the people—or collapse the delicate forces that keep the realm thriving.
- Demonym: Araethilene (AR-ay-THIL-een)
- Adjectival form: Araethilion
- Capital: Aeralithil (AIR-ah-LITH-il)
- Doc: [Araethilion](./araethilion.md) (to be created)

## 🧑‍🌾 Humans

### 2) Ardenhaven (AR-den-HAY-vun) — The Haven Realm
- People: Humans (with small halfling/gnome/etc. minorities)
- Theme: Imperfect hope, post-war recovery, trying to do the right thing
- Government: Constitutional / Council Monarchy (monarch limited by lords, guilds, temples)
- Background: Starting region for heroes. Decent at heart but weighed down by war scars, edge corruption, and thin defenses. Treaties with the Empire remain tense. It’s a place where the party can genuinely make things better over time.
- Demonym: Ardenite (AR-den-ite)
- Adjectival form: Ardenic (AR-den-ik)
- Capital: Ardenford
- Doc: [Ardenhaven](./ardenhaven.md) (to be created)

### 3) Calderon Imperium (CAL-der-on im-PEER-ee-um) — The Ashen Empire
- People: Humans (with subject peoples and slaves/serfs)
- Theme: Oppressive order, unity by fear, human corruption
- Government: Centralized Imperial Autocracy with vast bureaucracy and secret police
- Background: Determined to unify humanity, the Imperium waged brutal wars that forged the Haven Realm in opposition. A stalemate birthed uneasy trade and colder peace. Now the Imperium quietly rearms and toys with dark magic, undead legions, or infernal pacts to finish what it started.
- Demonym: Ashenite (ASH-en-ite)
- Adjectival form: Ashenic (uh-SHEN-ik)
- Capital: Ironstead
- Doc: [Calderon-Imperium](./calderon-imperium.md) (to be created)

### 4) Merrowgate (MER-oh-gate) — The City of Bargains
- People: Mostly humans plus a mix of others
- Theme: Deals and contracts, masks and manipulation, hidden supernatural patronage
- Government: Merchant Oligarchy / Corrupt Republic (merchant princes, guildmasters, crime lords)
- Background: A neutral trade hub where everything is for sale. Prosperity flows from a mysterious Silent Patron—glimpsed as devil, dragon, god of wealth, or living city. Major contracts and policies subtly bend to the Patron’s long game while the council pretends it leads.
- Demonym: Merrowgater (MER-oh-gay-ter)
- Adjectival form: Merrowgatean (MER-oh-GAY-tee-an)
- Capital: Merrowgate
- Doc: [Merrowgate](./merrowgate.md) (to be created)

### 5) Elderholt (EL-der-HOLT) — The Coven Realm
- People: Humans, with witches as a distinct class/order
- Theme: Protection at a cost, generational sacrifice, stolen childhoods
- Government: Coven-Feudal (villages owe fealty to local covens under a High Coven / Witch-Queen)
- Background: Truly protected from monsters and curses—but the price is the Tithe: children taken to be raised as witches, living wards, or sacrifices. Some return as powerful protectors; many never do. Some whisper that the covens redirect or even create the threats they “contain.”
- Demonym: Elderholter (EL-der-HOLT-er)
- Adjectival form: Elderholtian (el-der-HOLT-ee-an)
- Capital: Elderstead
- Doc: [Elderholt](./elderholt.md) (to be created)

## ⚒️ Dwarves

### 6) Dulgarum (DOOL-gah-room) — The Oathbound Holds
- People: Dwarves
- Theme: Tradition, duty, suffocating loyalty, buried catastrophe
- Government: Clan Monarchy under a High King/Queen, elected but bound by ancient oaths
- Background: Mountain fortress-cities that swore to hold the line against something in the deep—demonic, eldritch, or worse. Prosperity and unity depend on hiding a secret war as casualties mount. Some fear the Holds are bound not only to oppose the horror, but to it.
- Demonym: Dulgaran (dool-GAR-an)
- Adjectival form: Dulgaric (dool-GAR-ik)
- Capital: Khargun-dur (KHAR-gun-DOOR)
- Doc: [Dulgarum-Oathholds](./dulgarum-oathholds.md) (to be created)

### 7) Garhammar Trade League (GAR-ham-mar) — The Free Guild-League
- People: Dwarves (heavy use of non-dwarf labor)
- Theme: Industry and innovation, profit over principle, weaponized neutrality
- Government: Guild Oligarchy / Trade League (mining, craft, mercantile guilds)
- Background: Outward-facing, kingless, ruled by charters and ledgers. Sells weapons, machines, and expertise to many sides—including humans and orcs. To outsiders: pragmatic modernists. To many dwarves: sellouts who betrayed old kin and pacts for profit.
- Demonym: Garhammaran (GAR-ham-MAR-an)
- Adjectival form: Garhammaran (GAR-ham-MAR-an)
- Capital: Garhammar
- Doc: [Garhammar-Trade-League](./garhammar-trade-league.md) (to be created)

## 🪓 Orcs

### 8) Garrok Confederation (GAR-rok) — Western Orc Confederation
- People: Orcs (with some mixed-heritage and warrior allies)
- Theme: Harsh honor, earned respect, distant but negotiable
- Government: Tribal Confederation with War Moots; temporary High War-Leader chosen in crisis
- Background: Honor and recompense guide life. Feuds can last generations, but promises are sacred. In peace, clans feud, raid, and trade; in war, they unify under a chosen leader—then disperse that power when the threat ends. Outsiders can earn friendship; betrayal can unite them in vengeance.
- Demonym: Garrokan (GAR-uh-kan)
- Adjectival form: Garrokan (GAR-uh-kan)
- Capital: Garrok
- Doc: [Garrok-Confederation](./garrok-confederation.md) (to be created)

### 9) Rakthok Horde (RAK-thok) — Eastern Orc Horde
- People: Orcs
- Theme: Survival, paranoia, spiritual turmoil, blighted homeland
- Government: Shamanic Warbands guided by a Vision Council that names a Chosen Warlord in crises
- Background: Born of lands twisted by old wars and curses. Shamans heed spirits and omens; when danger looms, a Vision Council empowers a ruthless, often pre-emptive campaign. Betrayed and exploited many times, they see enemies everywhere—perhaps because the world keeps trying to erase them.
- Demonym: Rakthoki (rak-THOH-kee)
- Adjectival form: Rakthok (RAK-thok)
- Capital: Rakthok
- Doc: [Rakthok-Horde](./rakthok-horde.md) (to be created)
