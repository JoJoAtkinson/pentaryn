# World Factions Overview

High-level index of major factions across cultures. Each entry links to a future dedicated document.

## 🧝‍♀️ Elves

### 1) Araethilion (AR-ay-THIL-ee-on) — Veiled Crown Theocracy

- People: Elves
- Theme: False divinity, beautiful tyranny, prosperity built on hidden suffering
- Government: Theocratic Autocracy under a “living god” and high priestly court
- Background: An "immortal" ruler is worshipped as a god who blesses forests, harvests, and arts. In truth, agelessness and prosperity are sustained by siphoning tiny amounts of life-force from every elf. Seers and dissidents fear ending the rite could free the people—or collapse the delicate forces that keep the realm thriving. Small exile enclaves hide beyond the borders, trading prophecies and forbidden lore.
- Demonym: Araethilene (AR-ay-THIL-een)
- Adjectival form: Araethilion
- Capital: Aeralithil (AIR-ah-LITH-il)
- Doc: [araethilion.md](araethilion/_overview.md)

## 🧑‍🌾 Humans

### 2) Ardenhaven (AR-den-HAY-vun) — The Haven Realm

- People: Humans (with small halfling/gnome/etc. minorities)
- Theme: Imperfect hope, post-war recovery, trying to do the right thing
- Government: Constitutional / Council Monarchy (monarch limited by lords, guilds, temples)
- Background: Starting region for heroes. Decent at heart but weighed down by war scars, edge corruption, and thin defenses. Treaties with the Empire remain tense. It’s a place where the party can genuinely make things better over time.
- Demonym: Ardenite (AR-den-ite)
- Adjectival form: Ardenic (AR-den-ik)
- Capital: Ardenford
- Doc: [ardenhaven.md](ardenhaven/_overview.md)

### 3) Calderon Imperium (CAL-der-on im-PEER-ee-um)

- Nickname: "The Ashen Empire" (enemy slang referencing soot-choked factories and scorched-earth campaigns)
- People: Humans (with subject peoples and slaves/serfs)
- Theme: Oppressive order, unity by fear, human corruption
- Government: Centralized Imperial Autocracy with vast bureaucracy and secret police
- Background: Determined to unify humanity, the Imperium waged brutal wars that forged the Haven Realm in opposition. A stalemate birthed uneasy trade and colder peace. Now the Imperium quietly rearms and prepares for the next existential threat. Most citizens stay not from fear, but prosperity: safe roads, stable grain prices, functioning courts outweigh Ardenhaven's chaotic freedoms. Compulsory military service creates a veteran class deeply invested in the ideology of "order before all, unity through law." The use of undead auxiliaries at the front lines is an unspoken truth—everyone knows, no one discusses it openly. It's a grim calculus: better the risen dead hold the border than more living sons and daughters come home in boxes. The state frames it as pragmatic deterrence; most citizens quietly accept it as the price of security, though the moral weight sits heavy on the national conscience.
- Demonym: Calderonite (cal-DER-on-ite)
- Adjectival form: Calderonic (cal-der-ON-ik)
- Capital: Ironstead
- Doc: [calderon-imperium.md](calderon-imperium/_overview.md)

### 4) Merrowgate (MER-oh-gate) — The City of Bargains

- People: Multi-racial (humans, dwarves, halflings, elves, orcs—no single culture dominates)
- Theme: Deals and contracts, masks and manipulation, hidden supernatural patronage
- Government: Merchant Oligarchy / Corrupt Republic (merchant princes, guildmasters, crime lords)
- Background: A neutral trade hub where everything is for sale. Prosperity flows from a mysterious Silent Patron—glimpsed as devil, dragon, god of wealth, or living city. Major contracts and policies subtly bend to the Patron's long game while the council pretends it leads. Open to all who can pay; allegiance is measured in gold, not blood.
- Demonym: Merrowgater (MER-oh-gay-ter)
- Adjectival form: Merrowgatean (MER-oh-GAY-tee-an)
- Capital: Merrowgate
- Doc: [merrowgate.md](merrowgate/_overview.md)

### 5) Elderholt (EL-der-HOLT) — The Coven Realm

- People: Humans, with witches as a distinct class/order
- Theme: Protection at a cost, generational sacrifice, stolen childhoods
- Government: Coven-Feudal (villages owe fealty to local covens under a High Coven / Witch-Queen)
- Background: Truly protected from monsters and curses—but the price is the Tithe: children taken to be raised as witches, living wards, or sacrifices. Some return as powerful protectors; many never do. Some whisper that the covens redirect or even create the threats they “contain.”
- Demonym: Elderholter (EL-der-HOLT-er)
- Adjectival form: Elderholtian (el-der-HOLT-ee-an)
- Capital: Elderstead
- Doc: [elderholt.md](elderholt/_overview.md)

## ⚒️ Dwarves

### 6) Dulgarum (DOOL-gah-room) — The Oathbound Holds

- People: Dwarves
- Theme: Tradition, duty, suffocating loyalty, buried catastrophe
- Government: Clan Monarchy under a High King/Queen, elected but bound by ancient oaths
- Background: Mountain fortress-cities that swore to hold the line against something in the deep—demonic, eldritch, or worse. Prosperity and unity depend on hiding a secret war as casualties mount. Some fear the Holds are bound not only to oppose the horror, but to it.
- Demonym: Dulgaran (dool-GAR-an)
- Adjectival form: Dulgaric (dool-GAR-ik)
- Capital: Khargun-dur (KHAR-gun-DOOR)
- Doc: [dulgarum-oathholds.md](dulgarum-oathholds/_overview.md)

### 7) Garhammar Trade League (GAR-ham-mar) — The Free Guild-League

- People: Dwarves (heavy use of non-dwarf labor)
- Theme: Industry and innovation, profit over principle, weaponized neutrality
- Government: Guild Oligarchy / Trade League (mining, craft, mercantile guilds)
- Background: Outward-facing, kingless, ruled by charters and ledgers. Sells weapons, machines, and expertise to many sides—including humans and orcs. To outsiders: pragmatic modernists. To many dwarves: sellouts who betrayed old kin and pacts for profit.
- Demonym: Garhammaran (GAR-ham-MAR-an)
- Adjectival form: Garhammaran (GAR-ham-MAR-an)
- Capital: Garhammar
- Doc: [garhammar-trade-league.md](garhammar-trade-league/_overview.md)

## 🪓 Orcs

### 8) Garrok Confederation (GAR-rok) — Western Orc Confederation

- People: Orcs (with some mixed-heritage and warrior allies)
- Theme: Harsh honor, earned respect, distant but negotiable
- Government: Tribal Confederation with War Moots; temporary High War-Leader chosen in crisis
- Background: Honor and recompense guide life. Feuds can last generations, but promises are sacred. In peace, clans feud, raid, and trade; in war, they unify under a chosen leader—then disperse that power when the threat ends. Outsiders can earn friendship; betrayal can unite them in vengeance. Shares a long border with Ardenhaven; recent treaties allow limited trade and mutual defense pacts, though old raid-scars linger.
- Demonym: Garrokan (GAR-uh-kan)
- Adjectival form: Garrokan (GAR-uh-kan)
- Capital: Garrok
- Doc: [garrok-confederation.md](garrok-confederation/_overview.md)

### 9) Rakthok Horde (RAK-thok) — Eastern Orc Horde

- People: Orcs
- Theme: Survival, paranoia, spiritual turmoil, blighted homeland
- Government: Shamanic Warbands guided by a Vision Council that names a Chosen Warlord in crises
- Background: Born of lands twisted by old wars and curses. Shamans heed spirits and omens; when danger looms, a Vision Council empowers a ruthless, often pre-emptive campaign. Betrayed and exploited many times, they see enemies everywhere—perhaps because the world keeps trying to erase them. Clashes frequently with Calderon Imperium border legions; the Imperium views them as existential threats fueling arcane weapons research.
- Demonym: Rakthoki (rak-THOH-kee)
- Adjectival form: Rakthok (RAK-thok)
- Capital: Rakthok
- Doc: [rakthok-horde.md](rakthok-horde/_overview.md)
