## Symbol & Colors

**Symbol:** A broken skull wreathed in flames, pierced by a shamanic spear
**Colors:** Charred black, dried blood red, poison green
**Motto/Slogan:** "Strike first. Survive always."

## Mission & Goals

### Public Goals

Survival; expansion into unblighted lands; pre-emptive strikes against future threats; reclaiming lost spiritual power.

### True Goals

Escape the spiritual sickness plaguing their homeland; prove themselves worthy to the spirits who abandoned them; secure resources through any means; avoid extinction.

### Methods

Pre-emptive raids based on shamanic visions, scorched-earth survival tactics, brutal efficiency, spiritual rituals to appease angry ancestors, opportunistic alliances with any faction offering advantage.

## History

### Foundation

Unified during the Exodus when multiple orc tribes fled blighted lands that became spiritually corrupted and physically poisonous.

### Major Events

- The Blight ()
- 
- 
- **The Blight (Year TBD):** Homeland corrupted; spirits fell silent or turned hostile.
- **The Exodus (Year TBD):** Mass migration eastward; warbands united under shamanic guidance.
- **The First Betrayal (Year TBD):** Attempted alliance with Calderon Imperium ended in massacre; shaped current paranoia.
- **The Vision Wars (Year TBD):** Shamanic visions drove pre-emptive strikes across borders; created reputation as unpredictable aggressors.

### Current Situation

Desperate and dangerous. The Horde occupies marginal lands near Calderon Imperium borders, launching raids driven by shamanic prophecy and survival necessity. Spiritually adrift; ancestors demand blood and proof of strength. Internally fractured—warbands unified by the Chosen Warlord's visions but plagued by doubt and debate among shamans.

## Leadership Structure

### Hierarchy

Theocratic military hierarchy led by the Chosen Warlord (selected by Vision Council); shamans hold spiritual authority; warband leaders execute raids.

```
Vision Council (Shamans)
    ↓
Chosen Warlord (War + Spirit Authority)
    ↓
Warband Captains
    ↓
Raiders / Survivors
```

### Key Leaders

#### Chosen Warlord (Name TBD)

- **Title:** Voice of the Ancestors, First Striker
- **Role:** Supreme military and spiritual leader; interprets visions; commands all warbands
- **Description:** Scarred and haunted; claims to hear ancestors demanding conquest; feared and obeyed

#### High Shaman (Name TBD)

- **Title:** Keeper of Omens
- **Role:** Interprets visions; advises Warlord; mediates with ancestors
- **Description:** Ancient and cryptic; possibly manipulating visions for personal agenda

#### Warband Captain — The Red Fang (Name TBD)

- **Title:** Terror of the Border
- **Role:** Leads most aggressive raids into Calderon territory
- **Description:** Ruthless and efficient; believes only total victory will appease the spirits

## Resources & Assets

### Financial

- **Treasury:** Minimal; wealth measured in plunder and portable goods
- **Income Sources:** Raiding, scavenging, extortion of border settlements

### Military

- **Forces:** Mobile warbands (fast-strike raiders), berserkers, shamanic war-casters
- **Equipment:** Scavenged and looted; functional but mismatched

- **Spellcasters:** Shamans (spiritual leaders and diviners), blood-witches (dark magic users)
- **Artifacts:** Ancestor totems, vision bones, cursed relics from the Blight

### Political

- **Influence:** Feared but isolated; no stable allies
- **Alliances:** Opportunistic and temporary; history of betrayal

## Locations

### [Headquarters — Rakthok](../locations/rakthok.md)

Fortified war-camp and shamanic ritual grounds; semi-permanent staging area for raids.

### The Blighted Lands (Former Homeland)

Corrupted territory to the east; uninhabitable but spiritually significant.

### Border Raiding Camps

Temporary encampments along Calderon Imperium borders; constantly relocated.

## Allies & Enemies

### Allies

- None permanent; occasional deals with Merrowgate merchants for weapons

### Rivals

- Garrok Confederation (seen as weak and compromised)

### Enemies

- **[Calderon Imperium](./calderon-imperium.md):** Primary target of raids; existential threat justifying Imperium's undead research
- Former allies who betrayed them during the Exodus

## Reputation

### Among Common Folk (Outside)

Monsters; unpredictable raiders who strike without warning; stories used to frighten children.

### Among Nobility

Existential threat; justify militarization and extreme measures (like Calderon's undead auxiliaries).

### Among Other Factions

Untrustworthy; desperate and dangerous; some sympathize with their plight but fear their methods.

## Activities & Operations

### Public Activities

Border raids into Calderon territory, scavenging expeditions, shamanic rituals at Rakthok.

### Secret Operations

Attempting to cleanse the Blighted Lands; seeking forbidden magic to restore spiritual connection; internal power struggles between shamans and warriors; covert trading with Merrowgate for weapons.

### Current Projects

Major raid planned based on recent visions; ritual to summon ancestors for guidance; investigating rumors of magical solution to the Blight.

## Quests & Involvement

### Quests Offered

- Retrieve a sacred relic from the Blighted Lands to appease the ancestors.
- Prove yourselves in a raid to earn the Horde's temporary trust.

### Related Quests

- Negotiate a ceasefire between the Horde and Calderon Imperium (nearly impossible).
- Investigate the true cause of the Blight (potentially redemptive).

## Player Faction Reputation

| Character | Rank | Reputation | Notes |
| --------- | ---- | ---------- | ----- |
|           |      |            |       |

### Reputation Effects

- **Friendly (25+):** Warband protection, share of spoils, shamanic counsel, invited to rituals
- **Neutral (0-24):** Cautious distance; not attacked on sight but watched
- **Hostile (-25 to -1):** Targeted for raids, hunted as enemies, no negotiation

## Secrets & Mysteries

The Blight was not natural—evidence suggests the Horde's ancestors committed a terrible atrocity that cursed their homeland. The Vision Council knows but conceals the truth. Some shamans believe the visions are not from ancestors but from the entity causing the Blight, manipulating the Horde into self-destruction. The Chosen Warlord may be intentionally misinterpreting visions to justify conquest rather than atonement.

## Plot Hooks

1. A defecting shaman reveals the Blight's true origin; the party must decide whether to expose the lie or help the Horde atone.
2. A raid based on false visions targets an innocent Ardenic village; the party must stop it without igniting full war.
3. The Blighted Lands stir with ancient magic; the Horde and Imperium both seek it, and the party is caught between them.

## DM Notes

### Using This Faction

Rakthok should feel tragic and terrifying. They are not evil for its own sake—they are desperate survivors driven by paranoia, prophecy, and survival instinct. Show their brutality but also their spiritual anguish. Redemption is possible but requires confronting uncomfortable truths.

### Future Plans

The true nature of the Blight is revealed; internal schism between shamans seeking atonement and warriors demanding conquest; potential alliance with Ardenhaven if the Imperium threat becomes existential for both.
