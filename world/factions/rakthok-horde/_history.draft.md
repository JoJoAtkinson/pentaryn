- date: -125

- event_id: rakthok-iron-ledger-takes-fields

- title: The Iron Ledger Takes Our Kin’s Fields
- summary: calderon-imperium seizes great swaths of garrok-confederation land and drives the orcs deeper into the swamp-lows. They do it with paperwork and spearpoints alike—order written in blood, stamped and filed.

### year -124 (A.F. 4203)
- event_id: rakthok-blood-on-unfinished-stone

- date: -124
- duration: 0
- title: Blood on Unfinished Stone
- summary: garrok-confederation strikes back at the calderon-imperium reach, hurling bodies against half-raised walls and wet mortar. Thousands die beneath arrows and falling stone; the Imperium counts the dead as if tallying grain.

- duration: 0
- title: The Quiet Cull of Dakgar
- summary: the Imperium’s “pacifications” begin: night raids, bound captives, villages emptied for labor and “relocation.” Those who flee speak of soldiers with eyes like polished iron—no rage, no mercy, only procedure.

### year -121 (A.F. 4206)
- event_id: rakthok-tribute-in-teeth

- date: -121
- duration: 0
- title: Tribute in Teeth
- summary: calderon-imperium erects toll posts and ration yards, demanding “tax” for the crime of surviving on stolen ground. When the Garrok refuse, the Imperium answers with public hangings and private pits—less a war than a harvest.

### year -120 (A.F. 4207)

- date: -120
- duration: 0

- summary: calderon-imperium begins raising their capital-fortress over the barrier ground of the dakgar tribe of the garrok-confederation. They pour foundations through ancestral barrow grounds and call it progress.

- tags: calderon-imperium;politics;
- date: -118
- duration: 0
- title: The Name “Ironstead”
