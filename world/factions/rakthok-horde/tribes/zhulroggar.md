## Overview

(the Zhulrog, a big body of water in the lands of the Horde- there's several large bodies of water on your map)

A warlike tribe of the Horde that believes the Imperium's encroachment is a challenge sent by the Spirits to strengthen the Horde and ready them for the Karvok, the End Times when the Great Serpent Slakkar swallows the world, consuming all life and freeing it from the shackles of flesh and leaf.

## Governance & Civic Life

## Culture & Practices

## Attitude Toward Outsiders

The other tribes think the Zhulrog'gar are a bit nuts, but since they're really good at fighting the Imperium and their crazy beliefs aren't really hurting anyone (except, again, the Imperials) they're tolerated and even welcomed by some tribes.

They are allied with the Dakmar'nak and greatly appreciate the militarily weaker tribe's metalworking expertise and weaponscraft.
