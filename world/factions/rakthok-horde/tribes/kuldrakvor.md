## Identity

| Attribute | Value |

## Overview

(I don't know where the border of the Imperium is exactly but I figure the tail end of those mountains look like they enter the Horde territory, so somewhere around there?)

A powerful tribe with much authority, the Kuldrak'vor are the greatest of all the tribes. Their power and territories are second to none, and they are said to be held in high esteem by the Spirits.

Of late, though, something has shifted. They have become more withdrawn and less boisterous, less interested in leading raids against the Imperium and more focused on "interpreting the wishes of the Spirits", they say.

## Governance & Civic Life

What this means is unclear, but some say the Keeper of Omens, High Shaman of the Horde and Chief Shaman of the Kuldrak'vor may be manipulating the visions or their interpretations for his own end... but speaking such things aloud is very dangerous these days.

## Culture & Practices

## Attitude Toward Outsiders

The Kuldrak'vor do not take kindly to those who insult their, or their leader's, honor.

The people of Kuldrak have a longstanding rivalry with the Dakmar'nak, a dispute about old trade slights that are more or less irrelevant in these times, but the grudge has held on.
