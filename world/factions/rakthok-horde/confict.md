# The Raids Never Stopped

The Calderon Imperium has never stopped the raids; they keep the orc lands destabilized so their incursions can harvest what the Imperium truly seeks: fresh bodies for soul-bound undead—but never orc bodies. The Imperium has no interest in raising orc dead as shambling fodder. What they want are their own elite soldiers, volunteers who undergo a dark rite to have their souls ritually rebound to their bodies after death. These soul-bound undead are tireless, effectively *eternal*, and far more powerful than they were in life.

The Rakthok shamans are no fools. Generations of war have taught them to read the enemy. They have watched the Imperium's necromancers ignore piles of their own dead to fight over specific bodies—always the ones with the thumb-sized spiral sigil seared above the heart, a bronze-black scar that never cools. The shamans call these the **Heart-Marked**, and they have learned that the necromancers prize them above all others.

The shamans do not know what ritual creates the mark, or why these soldiers matter more than the rest. But they have observed enough to piece together a grim understanding: the sigil is a *key*. When a Heart-Marked soldier falls, the necromancers can call their soul back. The Heart-Marked rise as something else: tireless, aware, and bound by chains the shamans cannot see.

The eldest shamans have debated this for decades around council fires. Why does the Imperium not simply crush the Horde? They have the numbers. They have the deathless soul-bound legions. The answer, the shamans believe, is that the Imperium *needs* this war. Not to conquer—to *harvest*. Every battle is a reaping. Every Heart-Marked soldier who falls on Rakthok soil is a seed planted for the Imperium's eternal army. The orcs are not the enemy; they are the whetstone. They are the altar.

This knowledge burns. The Horde fights not to win, but to deny. To take what the Imperium wants most.

These tactics have forced the Rakthok to develop brutal countermeasures: taking heads as trophies, using weapons designed to completely eviscerate their targets, and denying the Imperium any chance to recover intact remains.

This, of course, makes the Rakthok appear even more vile and inhuman to outsiders, causing other nations to distance themselves and leaving the Horde more isolated. Worse, it gives the Calderon Imperium perfect justification to continue their raids, framing the orcs as monsters who must be contained at any cost.

## Outside Perception: The Era of Trade

From the wider world's perspective, this age is known as **Era of Trade**. Merchants, diplomats, and scholars speak of open borders, new markets, and carefully negotiated tariffs. The endless bloodshed in Rakthok Horde lands is not reconized as a war at all.

Beyond the Horde, few recognize the conflict as anything more than a distant nuisance. The Calderon Imperium does not officially acknowledge a war; its ledgers and proclamations describe only minor border skirmishes and a “manageable dispute over trade routes.”

Travelers from the Rakthok soon discover the common sentiment in Ardenhaven: the “eastern orcs” are seen as backwards raiders who ought to learn from the more “civilized” western orcs—this despite Ardenhaven’s deep distrust of Calderon itself.

To the Horde, this indifference is madness. A life of burned villages, slaughtered kin, and ceaseless raids is being dismissed as paperwork and tariffs. What the Rakthok know as a generations-long war, the rest of the world treats as a footnote to commerce.

*To understand why the Horde endures despite this isolation, one must look past the battlefield.*

# Governance 

Outsiders say the eastern orcs are ruled by warlords—one iron-fisted chief at the top and a pyramid of killers beneath. That is what the world sees when the Horde is marching. Inside the camps, the truth is quieter and far more complicated.

Each tribe is led by a **Chief Shaman**, the tribe's spiritual authority. The Chief Shaman is almost always an elder and not a frontline warrior. They are chosen in council, not seized by strength: hearth-mothers, elders, and proven hunters gather, argue, and finally agree on who will speak with the ancestors for their people. A Chief Shaman can be challenged, but only in council and only with visions and witnesses, not blades.

Beneath each Chief Shaman sits a **Fire Council**—the heads of the major hearth-families. They argue over food, pasture, grudges, and raids. When a raid must be called, the Fire Council names a **War Voice**: a champion who commands in battle but answers to the council and the Chief Shaman. If a War Voice squanders lives or ignores omens, the council can strip them of the role.

When visions warn of threats too large for a single tribe, the Chief Shamans leave their circles and gather as the **Vision Council**. From this council, they name a **Chosen Warlord** to carry the Horde's will in war. To outsiders, it looks as if the Warlord rules alone. In truth, he is a mask worn by the Vision Council and held on a short leash by the spirits and the shamans who listen to them.

Outsider scribes draw the Horde like this:

Chosen Warlord
    ↓
Warband Captains
    ↓
Raiders / Survivors
```

But inside the Horde, the orcs know it truly looks like this:

```text
Chief Shamans (Tribal Circles)  ←→  Fire Councils  [mutual counsel; neither commands the other]
                ↑
         Vision Council
                ↓
         Chosen Warlord (War Voice of the Horde)
                ↓
         Warband Captains
                ↓
         Raiders / Survivors
```
