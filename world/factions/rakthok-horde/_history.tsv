They name Garrok soil "unused" and call the living marsh "waste."

They do it with paperwork and spearpoints alike—order written in blood, stamped and filed.

Thousands die beneath arrows and falling stone; the Imperium counts the dead as if tallying grain.

Every plank is a promise: they intend to stay, and they intend to make the land obey.

Those who flee speak of soldiers with eyes like polished iron—no rage, no mercy, only procedure.

When the Garrok refuse, the Imperium answers with public hangings and private pits—less a war than a harvest.

They pour foundations through ancestral barrow grounds and call it progress.

A dispute arises with the Imperium and the now-displaced orcs, and in the subsequent conflict Zarkul is found dead, knifed in the back. Among the Horde his name is kept only as a curse: proof that gold is softer than mud, and twice as deadly.

To the Imperium, a thing is true once it is written; the land is forced to agree later.

The third shaft didn't stop him—he bit stone and kept climbing—until a falling block broke his ribs. Stone broke before flesh, but it was not a lesson writ large: the fortress held.
rakthok-warlord-zorgar-zhulvorg-bridge         	 rakthok-horde;battle;calderon-imperium                             	 4219	        0	 Warlord Zor'gar Zhulvorg Death        	 Zor'gar Zhulvorg hit the toll yards at dawn. When their captain tried to retreat with prisoners, Zor'gar caught him, and dragged him, his wagon, and his guards into the waters allowing the captives to escape. He drowned smiling, fingers locked on the captain's gorget.

Imperium sappers threw smoke and white lime to blind the charge, and crossbow bolts cracked from the haze. Gruknar died on her knees, and Ironstead rose up tall.

Thrakrok Rakthokgar refused the capture—charged into the hooks, killed two, and tore a third's jaw loose before pikeheads found him.
rakthok-warlord-ghorzul-morvorg-ashwinter      	 calderon-imperium;battle;rakthok-horde                             	 4229	        0	 Warlord Ghorzul Morvorg Death         	 In the Ash Winter the Imperium came with engineers and "clean fire" to burn the marsh open. Ghorzul Morvorg held the gorge mouth with a handful of spears, letting flame take his cloak so his warband could slip away through smoke and reeds. He died blackened and standing—a silhouette against the blaze—so the Horde could breathe and regroup.
rakthok-warlord-ugrok-gronmog-marshfire-push   	 rakthok-horde;battle;calderon-imperium                             	 4235	        0	 Warlord Ug'rok Gronmog Death          	 Ug'rok Gronmog led the Marshfire Push—bog oil on arrows, reeds lit like torches, war-cries echoing off wet stone. He reached the standard-bearer and ripped the banner free, wrapping it around his fist so it couldn't be reclaimed. They killed him for it; both he and the banner sunk into the swamp.
rakthok-warlord-nazgath-skorvorg-iron-judgement	 calderon-imperium;battle;rakthok-horde                             	 4236	        0	 Warlord Aznath Skorvorg Death         	 The Imperium answered the Marshfire Push with roadside courts—"justice" while the condemned still breathed. Aznath Skorvorg led a surpise attack against the scaffold, split the magistrate's table, and shattered the chains of the prisoners. She died under spearpoints, but the captives escaped. The tale is a prayer: when the Heart-Marked bring paper, we bring teeth.
rakthok-warlord-kragzor-dakmarnak-reed-ambush  	 rakthok-horde;battle;calderon-imperium                             	 4237	        0	 Warlord Kragzor Dakmar'nak Death      	 Kragzor Dakmar'nak taught the warbands to fight like the marsh—quiet, patient, suddenly everywhere. The night he died, he lured an Imperium patrol into deep water and took the captain's throat with his own teeth when blades were lost to the swamp. The Heart-Marked never found his body; the Dakmar'nak say he joined the marsh and became its anger.
rakthok-warlord-bazruk-thrumdun-ration-yard    	 calderon-imperium;battle;rakthok-horde                             	 4246	        0	 Warlord Uzruk Thrukdun Death          	 They called it a ration yard; it was a pen—families lined up like livestock while the Imperium measured hunger in ounces. Uzruk Thrukdun sought to break the gate and free her people, but she and her raiders were broken first. As she lay dying the yard captain mocked her failure, only to have his heart cleft by the warlord's knife. Even in death the Rakthok fight to win.
rakthok-warlord-zokgar-zharzug-knifewater      	 rakthok-horde;battle;calderon-imperium                             	 4252	        0	 Warlord Zokgar Zharzug Death          	 Zokgar Zharzug fought at the narrows, where retreat means drowning. No shields—only spears. When Calderon soldiers tried to cross on bodies, Zokgar went under with them and pulled three down; the crossing failed and the water ran red.
rakthok-warlord-graknak-zhulrog-frost-ballista 	 calderon-imperium;battle;rakthok-horde                             	 4253	        0	 Warlord Graknak Zhulrog Death         	 The Imperium brought a runed ballista to the lake shore, and its frost-rimed bolt cracked armor like spirit-bone. Graknak Zhulrog charged anyway—because that is what warlords do when the world changes and the young are watching. They remember him not for the death, but for the moment before it: tusks bared, feet sure on ice, roaring the Ancestors' names so loudly the frame shook. The ballista never stopped shooting.
rakthok-warlord-rokzug-ghorzug-three-bridges   	 rakthok-horde;battle;calderon-imperium                             	 4262	        0	 Warlord Orzak Ghorzug Death           	 Orzak Ghorzug hunted supply carts like a wolf hunts the slow. At the Three Bridges she sprang another trap—fire in the reeds, blades from below—but they were ready. The Heart-Marked answered with disciplined crossbow volleys and turned the ambush into a rout.
rakthok-warlord-durzgar-rakthokgar-barrier-line	 calderon-imperium;battle;rakthok-horde                             	 4265	        0	 Warlord Durzgar Rakthokgar Death      	 The Imperium pushed hard that year—more boots, more iron, more "order"—and the barrier line buckled like wet wood. Durzgar Rakthokgar stood in the breach with two spears and a shattered shield, refusing to let the innocents behind him become numbers in a clerk's book. When he fell, the warband swore the Spirits leaned in close to hear his last breath.
rakthok-warlord-mogrok-morvorg-siege-hook      	 rakthok-horde;battle;calderon-imperium                             	 4266	        0	 Warlord Mogrok Morvorg Death          	 Mogrok Morvorg led a night counter-raid against the Imperium's siege lines, cutting ropes and slitting throats with the same practiced calm. When the Heart-Marked tried to drag a captive shaman away on hooks, Mogrok threw himself into the chain and tore it apart with his bare hands. He died there—hands ruined, chest opened—so the shaman could crawl back to the fire and speak the names of the dead.
rakthok-warlord-vorzok-gronmog-boggate         	 calderon-imperium;battle;rakthok-horde                             	 4277	        0	 Warlord Orzok Gronmog Death           	 The Imperium tried to build a "clean" gate through the mire, driving posts into sacred mud and calling it civilization. Orzok Gronmog led the defense in chest-deep water, where every step is a choice between drowning and killing. When the gate collapsed, it buried her; the bog kept her as a guardian, and the Heart-Marked still avoid that crossing.
rakthok-warlord-garnak-zhulvorg-last-spear     	 rakthok-horde;battle;calderon-imperium                             	 4290	        0	 Warlord Garnak Zhulvorg Death         	 Garnak Zhulvorg led the late-season push when food was thin and tempers thinner, because doing nothing felt like dying slowly. He broke their line long enough to reclaim a cart of stolen winter grain—and then the Heart-Marked countered with perfect, soulless timing. They remember Garnak by the spear he threw as he fell: straight as a vow, wet with blood, aimed at the officer's throat like a promise.
rakthok-northern-wall-chokes-trade             	 calderon-imperium;economy;rakthok-horde                            	 4290	        0	 The Northern Wall Chokes Trade        	 calderon-imperium completes a new wall and checkpoint line, strangling the northern trade routes into the Horde. They call it "customs." Except they no orc is allowed passage; it just an ouright blockade.
rakthok-calderon-harvest-their-dead            	 rakthok-horde;lore                                                 	 4291	        0	 The Harvest Carts                     	 The Imperium stops chasing us into reeds and sinkholes. Instead, after every fight, black carts come—hooks, chains, salt, and clerks with clean hands—dragging their own dead back behind the walls. They no longer leave bodies for the marsh. They gather them like seed.
rakthok-shamans-heart-marked                   	 rakthok-horde;inspiration                                          	 4296	        0	 The Shamans foretell Heart Marked     	 Shamans read the signs: **identifies Heart-Mraked**, runes over the foes heart. Calderon mines for there own elite soldiers.

The bodies are left where they were laid. The story runs ahead of the carts and crosses every border, told in whispers that never match.

The tribe abandons its northern lands and migrates south, folding its camps into the Horde's nearer marches.

The Zharzug migrate south and settle alongside the Morvorg, remaining distinct tribes while sharing a joint circle of shamans.

Survivors withdraw west.
