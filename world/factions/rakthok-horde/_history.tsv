rakthok-soulless-measure-frontier	calderon-imperium;crime;rakthok-horde	4201	0	The Soulless Measure the Frontier	calderon-imperium surveyors and clerks arrive first—stakes, ink, and cold smiles. They name Garrok soil “unused” and call the living marsh “waste.”
rakthok-iron-ledger-takes-fields	calderon-imperium;conflict;rakthok-horde	4202	0	The Iron Ledger Takes Our Kin’s Fields	calderon-imperium seizes great swaths of garrok-confederation land and drives the orcs deeper into the swamp-lows. They do it with paperwork and spearpoints alike—order written in blood, stamped and filed.
rakthok-blood-on-unfinished-stone	rakthok-horde;battle;calderon-imperium	4203	0	Blood on Unfinished Stone	garrok-confederation strikes back at the calderon-imperium reach, hurling bodies against half-raised walls and wet mortar. Thousands die beneath arrows and falling stone; the Imperium counts the dead as if tallying grain.
rakthok-road-of-nails-marsh	calderon-imperium;infrastructure	4204	0	The Road of Nails Through the Marsh	calderon-imperium cuts a causeway into the swamp—trees felled, reeds burned, spirit-shrines trampled flat. Every plank is a promise: they intend to stay, and they intend to make the land obey.
rakthok-quiet-cull-of-dakgar	calderon-imperium;battle;rakthok-horde	4205	0	The Quiet Cull of Dakgar	the Imperium’s “pacifications” begin: night raids, bound captives, villages emptied for labor and “relocation.” Those who flee speak of soldiers with eyes like polished iron—no rage, no mercy, only procedure.
rakthok-tribute-in-teeth	calderon-imperium;economy;rakthok-horde	4206	0	Tribute in Teeth	calderon-imperium erects toll posts and ration yards, demanding “tax” for the crime of surviving on stolen ground. When the Garrok refuse, the Imperium answers with public hangings and private pits—less a war than a harvest.
rakthok-ironstead-rises-dakgar-bones	calderon-imperium;infrastructure	4207	0	Ironstead Rises on Dakgar Bones	calderon-imperium begins raising their capital-fortress over the barrier ground of the dakgar tribe of the garrok-confederation. They pour foundations through ancestral barrow grounds and call it progress.
rakthok-name-ironstead	calderon-imperium;government	4209	0	The Name “Ironstead”	calderon-imperium declares the new fortress city Ironstead as their capital and future seat, even as the walls remain hungry and incomplete. To the Imperium, a thing is true once it is written; the land is forced to agree later.
