# Guilds of Merrowgate — The City of Bargains

The guilds of Merrowgate are not simple trade organizations. They are power structures, identity markets, and shadow courts all at once. To be guilded in Merrowgate is to wear a second skin—a set of rules, protections, and obligations that define who you are more than blood or birthplace ever could. For a rogue, the guilds offer not just employment, but transformation: the chance to become someone else, to erase a past, to trade one life for another.

Below are seven aspects of Merrowgate's guild system that shape the lives of rogues, spies, and those who trade in secrets.

## 1. The Maskers' Compact — Identity as Currency

In Merrowgate, your face is not fixed. The **Maskers' Guild** controls the city's most lucrative and dangerous trade: **identity itself**. Through a combination of mundane disguise, magical alteration, and meticulously forged papers, the Maskers allow clients to become someone else—temporarily or permanently. A fugitive can walk the streets as a merchant prince. A spy can wear the face of a councilor's aide. A rogue with too many enemies can simply cease to exist and be reborn under a new name.

The service is expensive and binding. The Maskers do not simply hand you a new face and wish you luck. They track every identity they create, maintaining **Shadow Ledgers**—encrypted records of who was who, who paid for what, and which faces are active. This gives the guild enormous leverage. Cross them, and your true name resurfaces. Fail to pay your renewal fees, and the face you've worn for five years is quietly sold to someone else—or worse, to your enemies.

For rogues, the Maskers' Compact offers both liberation and entrapment. You can escape your past, but only by binding yourself to the guild. The deeper you go, the more they own you. Some rogues become **Face-Brokers**, specializing in acquiring identities for others—stealing papers, impersonating officials, or blackmailing those with valuable reputations. Others become **Unmaskers**, hunters paid to expose false identities and drag people back to their true names.

**At the table:** A rogue with ties to the Maskers can request identity forgeries, disguise services, or access to the Shadow Ledgers (at a cost). However, the guild expects loyalty. If you take a contract from them, failure means your own identity is at risk. The DM can introduce plot hooks where the party must track down a rogue using a stolen face, or where the rogue PC's own past identity resurfaces at the worst possible moment.

**The Price:** The Maskers do not demand blood or years. They demand **favors**. Every identity purchased, every face borrowed, is recorded as a debt. The guild calls in these debts when convenient—always at the worst time, always in ways that benefit the Silent Patron's unseen agenda. A rogue who has used the Maskers' services five times might find themselves ordered to deliver a package, steal a contract, or simply be in a specific place at a specific time—no questions asked, no explanations given.

## 2. The Ink & Sigil — Contracts That Bind More Than Law

The **Scriveners' Guild**, known colloquially as **The Ink**, controls all legal documentation in Merrowgate. Every contract, every deed, every bill of sale must pass through their hands. On the surface, this is bureaucracy. In practice, it is sorcery.

The Scriveners are not merely clerks—they are **contract-binders**, specialists who enchant agreements to enforce themselves. A merchant who breaks a Scrivener-sealed contract might find their warehouse doors refusing to open. A debtor who flees might feel their legs grow heavier with each step away from the city. The magic is subtle, never violent, but always inexorable. It does not compel you to act—it simply makes the consequences of betrayal immediate and undeniable.

For rogues, the Ink offers two paths: **Forger** or **Breaker**. Forgers specialize in crafting false contracts that mimic the Scriveners' enchantments well enough to pass inspection—for a time. Breakers specialize in unmaking contracts, finding loopholes, exploiting ambiguous wording, or (in desperate cases) physically destroying the original document before the magic can take hold. Both paths are highly illegal. Both are highly profitable.

The Scriveners know forgeries exist. They tolerate them—up to a point. Small-time forgers are occasionally caught and made examples of, but the truly skilled ones are quietly recruited. The guild would rather absorb talent than eliminate it. This creates a strange underworld where master forgers operate with the guild's tacit approval, trading information and occasionally receiving "freelance" assignments from the Scriveners themselves.

**At the table:** A rogue with Scriveners' contacts can attempt to forge documents, break contracts, or gain access to sealed agreements. However, every forgery risks exposure, and every broken contract leaves magical traces. The DM can introduce plot hooks where the party must steal an original contract before its magic activates, forge travel papers to cross a hostile border, or negotiate with a Scrivener who discovered their forgery and now demands payment in secrets.

**The Price:** The Scriveners demand **silence**. Every forger who works with the guild is bound by an unspoken rule: you do not reveal your methods, you do not teach outsiders, and you do not expose the guild's complicity in the black market. Break this rule, and your own contracts—every deal you've ever made, every agreement you've ever signed—are suddenly subject to "review." The Scriveners do not need to kill you. They can simply reinterpret your debts until you are buried under obligations you never agreed to.

## 3. The Tithe of Faces — Children of Debt

Not everyone comes to Merrowgate by choice. The city's prosperity is built on trade, but its underworld runs on **debt-bondage**. Families drowning in loans, merchants ruined by tariffs, refugees fleeing war—all of them can be offered the same terrible bargain: sell your child's future, and your debts are cleared.

The **Foundling Houses** are where these children go. Publicly, they are orphanages funded by generous guildmasters. Privately, they are training academies where children are raised to serve the guilds. A child sold to the Foundling Houses loses their name, their family, and their past. They are given a guild-name, taught a guild-trade, and shaped into whatever the city needs: spies, enforcers, forgers, couriers, or face-brokers.

By the time they reach adulthood, they are **guild-sworn**—bound by contracts signed when they were too young to understand, too desperate to refuse. Most never question it. They know no other life. But some do. Some remember the faces of parents who gave them up. Some dream of freedom beyond the contracts that define them. These are the rogues who become **Oathbreakers**, those who risk everything to escape the guilds that own them.

**At the table:** A rogue with a Foundling House background starts with guild training (proficiency in Thieves' Tools, Disguise Kit, or Forgery Kit) but also carries a **debt contract**. The guild can call on them for missions, and refusal means escalating consequences.

**The Price:** The Foundling Houses do not demand years or blood. They demand **loyalty tested**. Every child raised in the Houses is eventually given a test—an assignment that forces them to choose between their own morals and the guild's demands. Burn a rival's shop. Steal from a mentor. Betray a friend. The guild wants to see if you will break your own principles to serve them. Those who pass become trusted operatives. Those who fail are quietly discarded—or worse, exposed and used as examples.

## 4. The Silent Coin — The Guild of Problems That Never Were

The **Silent Coin** is not a guild you join. It is a guild that finds you—but only if you can afford it.

For the extraordinarily wealthy, the Silent Coin offers a service no other guild can match: they make problems **disappear**. Not through violence, not through forgery, not through negotiation. They simply arrange the world so that the problem never existed in the first place. A rival merchant who was about to expose your fraud withdraws their accusation, citing "new evidence" that vindicates you completely. A judge who was going to rule against you suddenly retires early, and their replacement happens to owe your family a favor. A dangerous witness vanishes—not dead, simply relocated to another city with a new identity and enough coin to start fresh, far away from anyone who might ask questions.

The Silent Coin does not break contracts or forge documents. They do not need to. They operate at a level above such crude methods. They **move the pieces** until the problem resolves itself in your favor. They bribe the right people, call in old debts, arrange convenient accidents, and orchestrate social pressure until everyone involved concludes that pursuing the matter further is simply not worth the trouble.

The price is staggering. A single intervention can cost what a common merchant earns in a decade. The Silent Coin deals exclusively with merchant princes, guild masters, councilors, and nobles—those for whom the cost is merely expensive, not impossible. A lesser criminal with a bounty on their head cannot hire the Silent Coin. A desperate debtor cannot buy their services. The guild exists for the elite, and they are very, very careful to keep it that way.

What makes the Silent Coin so powerful—and so feared—is their patience. They do not wait for clients to come to them. They maintain their **network** constantly, for years at a time, even when no one is paying them. Informants are cultivated. Blackmail is gathered. Favors are stockpiled. Alliances are quietly forged. When a client finally does arrive with a problem, the Silent Coin already knows everyone involved, already has leverage in place, and can move immediately. To an outsider, it looks like magic. To the Silent Coin, it is simply preparation.

The guild operates with the smallest footprint of any major power in Merrowgate. No guild hall. No public records. No membership rolls. Most citizens have never heard of them. Even among the wealthy, the Silent Coin is spoken of in euphemisms—"discreet arrangements," "private consultations," "solutions for delicate matters." You do not approach them directly. You express interest to the right intermediary, and if they deem you worthy, someone will contact you. Maybe in a week. Maybe in an hour. Maybe never.

For rogues, the Silent Coin represents the highest tier of the underworld. You cannot hire them. You cannot join them. But you can **work for them**—if you are skilled enough, discreet enough, and ruthless enough. The Silent Coin employs a small number of operatives to execute their plans: couriers who deliver bribes, forgers who create false evidence, infiltrators who plant incriminating documents, and occasionally, enforcers who ensure that a "convenient accident" happens on schedule. These operatives are never told the full plan. They are given one task, paid extraordinarily well, and warned that failure or loose lips will result in their own problem being "solved" by the guild.

**At the table:** A rogue PC cannot hire the Silent Coin unless they are extraordinarily wealthy (10,000+ gold per intervention, minimum). However, they can work for the Silent Coin as an operative. The guild will contact them through an intermediary, offer a single task (deliver this package, plant this evidence, make this person disappear for three days), and pay well. The catch: you never know what you are part of. You might be helping a councilor escape justice. You might be framing an innocent person. You will never be told, and you are expected not to ask.

**The Price:** Gold. Vast amounts of it. But for operatives, the price is **complicity**. Every job you take for the Silent Coin makes you part of their web. They do not threaten you. They do not bind you with contracts. They simply remember. And if you ever become a problem yourself, they already know everything about you—because you helped them do it to someone else. The Silent Coin does not punish betrayal with violence. They punish it by making you the next problem that needs solving. And they are very, very good at their job.

## 5. The Unmarked — Those Who Serve No Guild

Not all rogues in Merrowgate are guilded. Some operate in the spaces between—too independent to swear oaths, too dangerous to ignore. These are the **Unmarked**, freelancers who take contracts from anyone, serve no master, and answer to no council. They are not outcasts; they are simply ungoverned.

The guilds tolerate the Unmarked because they are useful. When a guild needs deniability, they hire an Unmarked to do the work. When a councilor needs a problem solved without guild oversight, they call on someone who wears no colors and signs no contracts. The Unmarked operate in a gray zone of legality—not quite criminals, not quite legitimate, existing only because the guilds find them more useful alive than dead.

But this freedom comes with a cost. The Unmarked have no protections. If they are caught, no guild will vouch for them. If they are betrayed, no court will hear their case. They are always one mistake away from disappearing into the canals, and everyone knows it. The guilds allow the Unmarked to exist, but only as long as they remain useful—and small.

**At the table:** An Unmarked rogue can take contracts from any faction without guild obligations, but they cannot invoke guild protections or services. If they are arrested, no guild will intervene. If they are betrayed, they have no legal recourse. However, they also cannot be bound by guild contracts or forced to honor guild debts. They are free—and alone.

**The Price:** The Unmarked pay in **reputation**. Every job they take, every employer they betray, every contract they break is remembered. The guilds keep informal ledgers of Unmarked operatives, tracking their reliability. A rogue with a strong reputation can command high prices and selective contracts. A rogue with a poor reputation finds work drying up, enemies multiplying, and offers coming only from the desperate or the suicidal. Mechanically, the DM tracks the rogue's **Unmarked Standing** as a hidden score. High standing grants access to better contracts and higher pay. Low standing means the only jobs left are the ones no one else will take.

## 6. The Listeners — The Guild That Knows Everything

The **Listeners** do not deal in gold, contracts, or faces. They deal in the most valuable currency in the world: **information**. In every major city, in every court, in every trade hub across the known world, the Listeners are there—watching, listening, remembering. They are not bound to Merrowgate, though the city serves as one of their most valuable posts. After all, Merrowgate is where everyone passes through eventually. A merchant from Ardenhaven, a spy from the Calderon Imperium, an exile from Araethilion, a trader from Garhammar—they all come to the City of Bargains. And when they do, the Listeners are waiting.

The guild operates through a vast **international network** of informants. Servants who overhear their masters' conversations in Ardenford's council chambers. Dock workers who see which ships arrive under false flags in Merrowgate's harbor. Tavern keepers in Garrok who remember which clan leaders meet in secret. Prostitutes in Ironstead who learn what Calderonite officers reveal in their cups. Street urchins in Aeralithil who follow dissidents through the temple gardens. The Listeners cultivate sources everywhere, always listening, always watching, always remembering. No conversation is truly private, no matter which city you whisper in. Somewhere, someone is taking notes.

What makes the Listeners dangerous is not just what they know—it is how they **organize** what they know. Every scrap of gossip, every whispered rumor, every overheard secret is recorded in coded ledgers maintained by the guild's **Archivists**. These ledgers are cross-referenced, verified, and cataloged with obsessive precision. A wealthy merchant cheating on his wife might seem like harmless gossip. But when that merchant is negotiating a trade deal with a councilor who happens to be the woman's cousin, the information becomes leverage. The Listeners do not simply collect secrets—they map the city's hidden connections and sell that knowledge to whoever can pay.

The guild sells information in tiers. For a handful of silver, you can learn where a rival merchant drinks or which warehouse stores their most valuable goods. For gold, you can buy blackmail material—proof of an affair, evidence of embezzlement, documentation of illegal dealings. For a small fortune, the Listeners will conduct active surveillance: follow a target for weeks, infiltrate their household, and compile a complete dossier of their habits, contacts, and vulnerabilities. And for truly exorbitant prices, the Listeners offer their most exclusive service: **targeted disinformation**. They will plant false rumors, create fake evidence, and manipulate the information network itself to destroy a reputation or cover up a crime.

For rogues, the Listeners offer two paths: **Gatherer** or **Weaver**. Gatherers are the field agents—those who collect information by sitting in taverns, following targets, cultivating sources, and reporting everything back to the Archivists. Weavers are the analysts—those who study the coded ledgers, identify patterns, and craft intelligence reports that turn raw gossip into actionable leverage. Both paths require discretion, patience, and the ability to keep your own secrets while extracting everyone else's.

The Listeners maintain **listening posts** across the world: taverns where the drinks are cheap and the staff is attentive, bathhouses where the walls are thin, theaters where private boxes have hidden peepholes, and even temples where confessional booths are not quite as private as they seem. In Merrowgate, they have more posts than anywhere else—the city's neutral status and constant traffic make it the perfect hub for information gathering. But they also operate in Ardenford's merchant quarter, Ironstead's military districts, the trade roads leading to Garhammar, even the exile enclaves beyond Araethilion's borders. Listeners operatives frequent these places, cultivating the staff, befriending regulars, and slowly building relationships that yield information over time. It is slow work. A Listener might spend months gaining someone's trust before that person reveals a single useful secret. But the Listeners are patient. They do not need to know everything today. They can wait.

What makes the guild truly insidious is the **Reciprocity Rule**: to receive information from the Listeners, you must also provide information to them. Every client is expected to share what they know in exchange for what they learn. An Ardenite merchant who buys intelligence on a Calderonite rival is asked to report back on conversations at the next guild meeting. A Dulgarum noble who purchases blackmail material is required to pass along anything interesting they overhear in the Holds. A Garrokan war-leader who learns enemy positions must share what their scouts observe. This creates a self-sustaining network where information flows constantly inward from every corner of the world, and the Listeners grow more knowledgeable with every transaction. What happens in Ironstead is known in Merrowgate within days. What is whispered in Aeralithil reaches Ardenford before the week is out.

**The Price:** Privacy. Once you join the Listeners, you lose the ability to keep anything to yourself. Every secret you learn, you must share. Every rumor you hear, you must report. And the guild does not just track what you tell them—they track what you *don't* tell them. If a Gatherer overhears something valuable and fails to report it, the Archivists will notice the gap. They will ask why you held back. And if your answer is not satisfactory, your own secrets become the guild's next product.

Mechanically, a rogue affiliated with the Listeners must make a Deception check (DC 15) whenever they withhold information from the guild. On a failure, the Archivists realize the rogue is hiding something. The guild does not punish this immediately—they simply start watching the rogue more closely. After three failed checks, the rogue's own secrets (backstory details, hidden crimes, embarrassing truths) start appearing in the guild's ledgers—and those ledgers are for sale to anyone who can pay.

## 7. The Undercurrent — The Guild That Makes the Impossible Possible

Merrowgate is a city built on trade, where gold flows freely and contracts govern every exchange. But not all trade can be conducted in the light. Some deals are too dangerous. Some alliances too fragile. Some goods too restricted by faction law or international treaty. This is where **the Undercurrent** thrives—not as criminals hiding from the government, but as an essential pillar of Merrowgate's economy, openly seated at the Ledger Council's table.

The Undercurrent is Merrowgate's **black market guild**, recognized, respected, and utterly necessary. They are the ones who make deals that cannot officially exist. When the Calderon Imperium needs Dulgarum iron but cannot disclose the scale of their military buildup, the Undercurrent brokers it. When rival orc confederations need to trade across hostile territory, the Undercurrent arranges neutral ground. When Ardenhaven must purchase Garhammar weapons without alerting the Imperium, the Undercurrent delivers. They are the shadow diplomats, the back-channel negotiators, the ones who keep the world's economy moving when politics, law, and pride would otherwise lock it down.

The Undercurrent does not hide. They operate openly within Merrowgate, maintaining offices, warehouses, and even seats on city committees. Everyone knows who they are. Everyone knows what they do. And everyone—councilors, guild masters, foreign ambassadors—quietly relies on them. The city's neutrality depends on its ability to facilitate trade between enemies, and the Undercurrent is the mechanism that makes it work.

What makes the Undercurrent unique is not secrecy, but **plausible deniability**. A Calderonite general does not personally meet with an Araethilion exile to purchase forbidden relics. Instead, they meet with an Undercurrent broker in a Merrowgate counting house, and the transaction is logged as "miscellaneous artifacts from a neutral third party." An Ardenic lord does not openly violate treaty by buying Dulgarum siege engines. Instead, the Undercurrent arranges for the weapons to be "discovered" in an abandoned warehouse the lord conveniently purchases. The goods move. The gold flows. The official records remain clean. Everyone pretends not to notice.

The guild is organized around **international connections**, not hierarchies. A broker who can arrange deals between Calderonic generals and Garrokan war-leaders holds power. A trader who maintains trust with both Araethilion temple-exiles and Elderholt witch-covens controls access to forbidden goods. A diplomat who can navigate Dulgarum clan politics and Rakthok Vision Councils becomes indispensable. Power is measured by who trusts you across enemy lines, not by title or rank. The Undercurrent's leadership is the **Shadow Council**—senior brokers who sit on Merrowgate's Ledger Council openly, representing the guild's interests alongside legitimate merchants and craft masters.

For rogues, the Undercurrent offers three paths: **Broker**, **Courier**, or **Fixer**. Brokers are the negotiators—those who arrange deals between factions that officially cannot trade, navigating the complex web of treaties, embargoes, and political tensions that govern international commerce. Couriers are the smugglers themselves—those who move goods across hostile borders, through war zones, past customs checkpoints, delivering contraband that nations desperately need but cannot openly purchase. Fixers are the problem-solvers—those who create the plausible deniability, forge the false provenance, arrange the "accidental discoveries," and ensure that every illegal transaction has a legal-looking paper trail.

The Undercurrent's relationship with Merrowgate is symbiotic, not adversarial. The guild pays tariffs on "legitimate" goods to maintain their legal standing. They contribute to city infrastructure. They employ hundreds of workers. They even enforce their own standards—rogue smugglers who operate without guild approval are reported to customs officials, not to eliminate competition, but to maintain the guild's reputation. The Ledger Council does not merely tolerate the Undercurrent; they rely on it. Half the city's wealth flows through black market channels, and everyone benefits. The Scriveners draft contracts for illegal deals, charging premium rates. The Listeners trade intelligence on foreign customs enforcement. Even the Silent Coin uses Undercurrent networks to relocate "problems" across international borders.

What keeps the Undercurrent essential is simple geopolitics. The world's factions need each other more than they can admit. The Calderon Imperium needs resources from nations it publicly opposes, but cannot acknowledge the dependency without undermining imperial propaganda. Dulgarum needs trade routes through territories held by ancient enemies, but pride forbids direct negotiation. Ardenhaven needs Garhammar weapons to defend against the Imperium, but open trade would provoke war. Araethilion requires rare materials from outside its borders, but admitting reliance on "lesser peoples" contradicts divine doctrine. The Undercurrent makes all of it possible. They are not criminals—they are diplomats who operate in the spaces where official diplomacy fails.

The guild operates through **international networks** built over generations. They maintain warehouses in every major city, fronted by legitimate businesses. They employ couriers who carry diplomatic immunity, merchants who own ships flying neutral flags, and brokers who speak a dozen languages and understand twice as many customs codes. In Merrowgate itself, the Undercurrent owns counting houses, auction halls, and storage facilities openly—no secrecy required. Their greatest asset is not hidden routes or secret tunnels, but **trust across enemy lines**. An Undercurrent broker's word is worth more than any treaty, because they have facilitated deals that kept nations alive when their own governments could not.

**At the table:** A rogue with Undercurrent contacts can broker deals between hostile factions, move restricted goods across international borders, or arrange meetings that officially never happened. The risk is not law enforcement—it is geopolitics. If a deal goes wrong, nations might go to war. If a shipment is intercepted, diplomatic crises erupt. The Undercurrent protects its own, but only as long as they maintain plausible deniability. 

A rogue working as a Broker gains access to international contacts and can arrange deals that would otherwise be impossible—but they are also responsible when those deals collapse. Nations do not forgive easily, and the Undercurrent will sacrifice a broker to preserve the guild's neutrality. A rogue working as a Courier travels the world carrying goods no customs official can acknowledge—but they carry the burden of knowing that failure might spark wars. A rogue working as a Fixer creates the legal fictions that make black market deals look legitimate—but they live in constant fear that someone will unravel the web of lies and trace it back to them.

**The Price:** **Complicity in Geopolitics**. The Undercurrent does not demand loyalty to Merrowgate—they demand loyalty to the deal. Every transaction you facilitate makes you complicit in keeping the world's powers dependent on black market channels. You help nations acquire what they cannot openly purchase. You enable regimes to circumvent their own laws. You facilitate alliances that would collapse if brought to light. You become a thread in the web of underhanded deals that keeps the world from open war—or from honest peace. The Undercurrent's members are not criminals. They are the people who know too much about how the world really works, and that knowledge is a burden.

Worse, the Undercurrent operates on **reputation across enemy lines**. If you betray a Calderonite client, the Imperium will never trust another Undercurrent broker again. If you fail a Dulgarum delivery, every dwarf clan will remember. The guild will protect you from rival smugglers, from customs officials, even from foreign assassins—but they will not protect you from the consequences of damaging the guild's international standing. A broker who ruins the Undercurrent's reputation with a major faction is not killed. They are simply expelled. And once you have been cast out of the one guild that operates across all borders, there is nowhere left to run.

Mechanically, a rogue affiliated with the Undercurrent gains a **Geopolitical Standing** score tracked by the DM. Every successful international deal increases standing by 1. Every failed deal, exposed shipment, or diplomatic incident decreases standing by 2. At standing 5+, the rogue is trusted to broker deals between major factions. At standing 0, the rogue can only handle minor transactions. At standing -5, the guild expels them—and every faction they ever dealt with is quietly informed that this person is no longer protected by Merrowgate's neutrality.

The deeper irony: the Undercurrent is the most open of all Merrowgate's guilds, operating in daylight, seated at the government's table, respected by nations—yet it traps you more completely than any shadow organization ever could. You are not bound by oaths or contracts. You are bound by the simple fact that you have seen how the world's powers survive, and you cannot unsee it. The Undercurrent does not hide from the government. They are the government's most valuable tool. And you are part of the machinery that keeps the world turning—one illegal deal at a time.
