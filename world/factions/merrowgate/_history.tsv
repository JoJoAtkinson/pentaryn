The first lottery winner is a low-level Scrivener clerk who serves with surprising effectiveness.

The movement gains momentum before being co-opted—the guilds offer improved conditions in exchange for continued service. Most accept.
merrgate-048	 merrowgate;government;lore                                         	 4324/06/14	        0	 The Silent Coin Succession       	 For the first time in living memory, the Silent Coin admits to a leadership transition. No details are provided about the old or new leadership. Clients notice no change in service quality, which somehow makes it more unsettling.
