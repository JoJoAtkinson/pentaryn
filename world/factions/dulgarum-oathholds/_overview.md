## Symbol & Colors

**Symbol:** An iron hammer crossed with a sealed gate on a mountain field  
**Colors:** Granite gray, iron black, bronze trim  
**Motto/Slogan:** "Oaths unto stone, stone unto eternity."

## Mission & Goals

### Public Goals
Hold the line against the horrors in the deep; preserve clan honor and dwarven tradition; maintain prosperity through duty and discipline.

### True Goals
Contain the entity they swore to oppose (or are bound to); prevent the truth of their pact from destabilizing the Holds; sustain the secret war at all costs, even if it bleeds the clans dry.

### Methods
Binding oaths enforced through clan law; rotating Deep Watch deployments; sealed breachgates hiding casualties; propaganda emphasizing duty over truth; exile or "voluntary mining accidents" for those who question.

## History

### Foundation
Established when the great clans swore the Binding of Oaths—a terrible pact to hold the line against something in the deepest mines. The exact nature of the threat (or their relationship to it) is classified.

### Major Events
- **The Binding of Oaths (Year TBD):** The foundational pact sealed in blood and stone.
- **The Sealing of the Ninth Gate (Year TBD):** A catastrophic breach was contained; an entire clan was lost.
- **The Whispered Schism (Year TBD):** Dissidents who questioned the oaths were exiled; they founded the Garhammar Trade League.

### Current Situation
Prosperous on the surface: strong forges, disciplined clans, cultural pride. Beneath: mounting casualties in the Deep Watch, whispers that the oaths bind them not only to oppose the horror but perhaps *to* it, and growing fear that the secret war is unwinnable.

## Leadership Structure

### Hierarchy
The High King/Queen (elected from great clans) rules with absolute authority in oath-matters; clan-lords govern holds; Deep Wardens command the secret war.

### Reputation Effects
- **Friendly (25+):** Access to legendary forges, Deep Watch intelligence, clan hospitality
- **Neutral (0-24):** Standard trade and defensive cooperation
- **Hostile (-25 to -1):** Barred from holds, Deep Watch surveillance, potential exile

## Secrets & Mysteries
The Binding of Oaths may not just oppose the horror—it may bind the Holds *to* it, sustaining both the threat and the defense in a terrible symbiosis. Evidence suggests supply trains feed something below. Some fear ending the oaths would unleash the horror; others fear the oaths are what keep it alive.

## Plot Hooks

1. A breached tunnel disgorges something the oaths cannot name; the Deep Watch requests discrete aid.
2. A clan heir discovers evidence that supply trains are feeding the entity, not just defending against it.
3. A rogue clan-lord proposes amending the oaths; traditionalists threaten civil war.

## DM Notes

### Using This Faction
Dulgarum is tragic duty incarnate. NPCs are honorable but trapped; the oaths are both salvation and curse. Players should uncover layers slowly, questioning whether the Holds are heroes or prisoners.

### Future Plans
A catastrophic breach forces the truth into the open; a faction seeks to end the oaths despite the risk; the entity below begins communicating, revealing the nature of the pact.
