# Ironstead

> The imperium’s iron seat: lawful, overt power, open borders under unbending rule.

- Culture: Human (Calderon Imperium — The Ashen Empire)
- Type: Capital city
- Faction: [Calderon Imperium](../_overview.md)

## Description
Ironstead is a city of straight, iron-banded boulevards and regimented districts built in basalt and steel. Parade grounds flank the central edict halls; banners march as often as legions. Everyone understands the bargain: prosperity and order in exchange for absolute obedience to imperial law.

## Points of Interest
- Edict Basilica — where imperial decrees are drafted, sealed, and proclaimed
- Legion Parade Grounds — ceremonial field and mustering square for cohorts
- Censorate Tower — administrative heart for audits, registrations, and investigations

## Adventure Hooks
- A new edict tightens border checks; a diplomat needs a lawful workaround.
- The Censorate flags a missing registry block tied to necromantic research.
- A legion review uncovers a defecting centurion with evidence of high treason.
