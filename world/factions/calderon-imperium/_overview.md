**Status:** Active

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Imperial Government / Autocracy |
| **Size** | Continental power |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Neutral (authoritarian tendencies) |
| **Headquarters** | [Ironstead](locations/ironstead.md) |
| **Founded** | The Consolidation Era (exact year TBD) |

## Symbol & Colors

**Symbol:** A black iron crown over crossed fasces on a basalt field  
**Colors:** Ash-black, iron-gray, blood-red trim  
**Motto/Slogan:** "Order before all."

## Mission & Goals

### Public Goals
Peace, prosperity, and uniform law across open borders; secure trade, safe roads, and a single, stable rule of law for all residents.

### True Goals
End all rival human polities under Imperium law; deter foreign threats by overwhelming, disciplined power; quietly pursue arcane deterrents (undead legions/infernal treaties as last-resort options).

### Methods
Codified edicts, census and permits, professional legions, engineered infrastructure, secret police for treason and subversion, selective arcane R&D.

## History

### Foundation
Formed after decades of civil wars and border feuds, when the Calderon dynasts unified the heartlands under a permanent edict code and standing legions.

### Major Events
- **The First Marches (Year TBD):** Legionary campaigns that broke the last city-states.
- **The Treaty of Havens (Year TBD):** Stalemate and formal borders with the Haven Realm.
- **Censorate Reform (Year TBD):** Centralized registries; permits required for guilds, cults, and foreign agents.

### Current Situation
Rearming and modernizing. Officially trades with the Haven Realm while testing arcane deterrents in sealed facilities. The law is predictable but unbending: those who comply prosper; those who resist are crushed.

## Leadership Structure

### Hierarchy
An Emperor/Empress sits above the High Edict Council and the Censorate; provincial legates administer regions; prefects govern districts; cohorts enforce compliance.

Admin centers tied by roads and signal towers; each maintains an edict hall and cohort barracks.

### Territory
The core heartlands and annexed marches; recognized borders with the Haven Realm under the Treaties.

## Allies & Enemies

- Active insurgencies and outlaw cults; hostile foreign warbands when raids cross borders

## Reputation

Efficient, safe, and strict. Prosperity for the compliant; swift punishment for lawbreakers.

### Among Nobility
Respected and feared; little patience for hereditary privilege without service.

### Among Other Factions
Predictable partner; ruthless enforcer; suspected arcane overreach.

## Activities & Operations

Road building, levy collection, justice circuits, census audits, military reviews.

## Player Faction Reputation

| Character | Rank | Reputation | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|-------|
| | | | |

### Reputation Effects
- **Friendly (25+):** Priority permits, reduced tariffs, escorted travel
- **Neutral (0-24):** Standard treatment under the Edict Code
- **Hostile (-25 to -1):** Detentions, increased inspections, permit denials

## Secrets & Mysteries
Contingency edicts to deploy undead auxiliaries if an existential threat is verified; draft infernal compacts exist but remain unsigned.

## Plot Hooks

1. An edict tightening border checks threatens a festival; mediation under law is the only path.
2. A legate requests discrete proof of a cult inside a rival’s embassy.
3. A sealed lab’s fire reveals a forbidden research ledger.

## DM Notes

### Using This Faction
Make the Imperium reliable, readable, and relentless. It rewards process and punishes defiance. Conflicts hinge on interpretation of edicts, not random cruelty.

### Future Plans
An imperial census reform, an anti-necromancy tribunal showdown, and a brink-of-war parade on the Haven frontier.
