## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Tribal Confederation |
| **Size** | Regional orc power |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Neutral (with Chaotic Good honor codes) |
| **Headquarters** | [Garrok](../locations/garrok.md) |
| **Founded** | The First Moot (ancient era) |

## Symbol & Colors

**Symbol:** A crossed axe and spear over a fire-ring  
**Colors:** Blood red, ash gray, bone white  
**Motto/Slogan:** "Honor holds; blood remembers."

## Mission & Goals

### Public Goals
Maintain clan autonomy and honor; defend confederation territory; ensure recompense for grievances through lawful processes.

### True Goals
Balance independence with unity; preserve traditions while adapting to changing borders; earn respect (not fear) from neighbors; prove orcs can be negotiated with, not just fought.

### Methods
War Moots for crisis leadership, Oathfire Courts for dispute resolution, recompense law (blood-price and honor-debt systems), selective raiding to enforce boundaries, treaty diplomacy with Ardenhaven.

## History

### Foundation
Established at the First Moot when warring clans agreed to unify against external threats while preserving clan sovereignty.

### Major Events
- **The First Moot (Year TBD):** Founding council; confederation laws established.
- **The Blood-Price Wars (Year TBD):** Decades-long feuds ended through formalized recompense system.
- **The Ardenic Treaties (Year TBD):** First formal peace with Ardenhaven; mutual defense and limited trade.

### Current Situation
Stable but watchful. Shares a long border with Ardenhaven; recent treaties allow trade and mutual defense, though old raid-scars linger. Internally, clans feud and honor-debts accumulate, but promises are sacred. Outsiders can earn friendship; betrayal unites all clans in vengeance.

## Leadership Structure

### Hierarchy
No permanent central authority; temporary High War-Leaders chosen at War Moots during crises. In peacetime, clans self-govern under confederation law.

```
Clans (Autonomous)
    ↓
Chieftains (Clan Leaders)
    ↓
[War Moot] → High War-Leader (Crisis Only)
    ↓
Oathfire Judges (Dispute Resolution)
```

### Key Leaders

#### Current High War-Leader (Name TBD) — *if in crisis*
- **Title:** Chosen of the Moot
- **Role:** Unified military command during existential threats
- **Description:** Battle-scarred veteran with unmatched strategic mind; authority dissolves when threat ends

#### Oathfire Judge-Prime (Name TBD)
- **Title:** Keeper of Blood-Price
- **Role:** Arbitrates disputes; enforces recompense law
- **Description:** Ancient orc with memory spanning generations; impartial and feared

## Membership

Mootgrounds and longhouse courts; authority appointed in crisis, dissolved in peace.

### Oathfire Pits
Sacred sites where recompense is judged and blood-price settled.

### Territory
Borderlands, hill-forts, and clan territories along the Ardenic frontier.

## Allies & Enemies

### Allies
- **[Ardenhaven](./ardenhaven.md):** Recent mutual defense treaties; limited trade

### Rivals
- Other orc clans outside the confederation; border disputes with Calderon Imperium scouts

### Enemies
- Oath-breakers (individuals or factions); external forces threatening confederation autonomy

## Reputation

### Among Common Folk (Outside)
Honorable but dangerous; stories of brutal raids coexist with tales of kept promises.

### Among Nobility
Negotiable if you respect their law; vengeful if betrayed.

### Among Other Factions
Distant but stable; a model for "civilized" orc society; potential allies if trust is earned.

## Activities & Operations

### Public Activities
Clan governance, Oathfire Courts, selective raiding to enforce borders, trade caravans to Ardenhaven.

### Secret Operations
Surveillance of Imperium movements near borders; intelligence-sharing with Ardenic scouts; managing internal feuds to prevent escalation.

### Current Projects
Strengthening Ardenic trade routes; mediating a blood-feud that risks splitting two major clans; preparing for potential Imperium encroachment.

## Quests & Involvement

### Quests Offered
- Mediate a blood-price dispute before it escalates to clan war.

### Related Quests
- Escort an Ardenic diplomat to the Oathfire Pits for treaty renewal.

## Player Faction Reputation

| Character | Rank | Reputation | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|-------|
| | | | |

### Reputation Effects
- **Friendly (25+):** Clan hospitality, Oathfire advocacy, shared intelligence, mutual defense
- **Neutral (0-24):** Respectful distance; trade available but cautious
- **Hostile (-25 to -1):** Blood-price demanded, raids authorized, unified vengeance

## Secrets & Mysteries
Some clans secretly debate abandoning the confederation to join Rakthok or negotiate independently with the Imperium. A faction believes Ardenhaven will betray the treaties when convenient. Evidence suggests an ancient blood-oath binds the confederation to defend something beyond their borders.

## Plot Hooks

1. A single betrayal by an Ardenic official threatens to unify all clans in vengeance; the party must prove it was unauthorized.
2. A disputed recompense risks igniting a generational feud; Oathfire mediation requires neutral witnesses.
3. Scouts report Imperium forces massing near the border; a War Moot is called, and the party is invited to testify.

## DM Notes

### Using This Faction
Garrok should feel honorable and dangerous. NPCs are bound by rigid codes but respect those who understand them. Show both the violence of their justice and the loyalty it earns. Let players earn friendship through deeds, not words.

### Future Plans
An Imperium incursion tests the Ardenic alliance; a blood-feud splits the confederation; a charismatic chieftain proposes permanent centralization (threatening clan autonomy).
