## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Guild Oligarchy |
| **Size** | Regional dwarven power |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Neutral (with Neutral Evil profit-chasing) |
| **Headquarters** | [Garhammar](../locations/garhammar.md) |
| **Founded** | The Charter Revolt (post-Dulgarum schism) |

## Symbol & Colors

**Symbol:** A golden gear interlocked with a silver hammer on a black field  
**Colors:** Gold, silver, industrial black  
**Motto/Slogan:** "Prosperity through freedom."

## Mission & Goals

### Public Goals
Maximize trade and innovation; provide quality goods and services to all buyers; maintain neutrality through economic indispensability.

### True Goals
Profit above all; expand influence through weaponized neutrality; free themselves from Dulgarum's "backward" oaths while still benefiting from dwarven reputation.

### Methods
Charter law (all policy decided by guild votes weighted by capital), arbitration services sold to all sides, weapons exports to multiple factions, leveraging debt and dependency, heavy use of non-dwarf labor to cut costs.

## History

### Foundation
Born from the Whispered Schism: dwarves who refused the Binding of Oaths fled Dulgarum and established a kingless society ruled by guild charters.

### Major Events
- **The Charter Revolt (Year TBD):** Founding exodus from Dulgarum; first charters signed.
- **The Arms Accords (Year TBD):** Garhammar sells weapons to both Calderon Imperium and Ardenhaven during their war; profits massively.
- **The Debt Crisis (Year TBD):** A client state defaults; Garhammar seizes its mines and infrastructure.

### Current Situation
Richer and more outward-facing than Dulgarum, but culturally conflicted. Many dwarves see the League as pragmatic modernists; many others view them as sellouts who betrayed kin and oaths for gold. Non-dwarf labor is heavily exploited, creating internal tensions.

## Leadership Structure

### Hierarchy
The Guild Charter Council (guildmasters weighted by capital) votes on all policy; no single leader, only rotating speakers.

## Allies & Enemies

- **All factions** (as paying clients)

### Rivals
- **[Dulgarum](./dulgarum-oathholds.md):** Ideological and cultural tension; seen as oath-breakers

### Enemies
- Factions threatening free trade; insurgents targeting exploited labor

## Reputation

### Among Common Folk
Dependable but mercenary; admired for innovation, despised for selling to enemies.

### Among Nobility
Essential for arms and arbitration; frustrating in negotiations.

### Among Other Factions
Pragmatic modernists or amoral profiteers, depending on perspective.

## Activities & Operations

### Public Activities
Weapons exports, machine sales, arbitration services, banking, mining operations.

### Secret Operations
Debt leverage to seize assets; espionage to maintain competitive advantage; exploitation of non-dwarf labor under harsh contracts; potential infernal consultants on ledgers.

### Current Projects
Expanding arbitration monopoly; testing arcano-industrial war machines; managing labor unrest in mining colonies.

## Quests & Involvement

### Quests Offered
- Recover stolen blueprints before a competitor reverse-engineers them.

### Related Quests

## Player Faction Reputation

| Character | Rank | Reputation | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|-------|
| | | | |

### Reputation Effects
- **Friendly (25+):** Discounted arms, arbitration priority, investment opportunities
- **Neutral (0-24):** Standard trade terms
- **Hostile (-25 to -1):** Inflated prices, contract denials, debt collection enforcers

## Secrets & Mysteries
Some guild charters are influenced by infernal counsel (similar to Merrowgate's Silent Patron but with devils instead). Exploited laborers are organizing; a massive strike or revolt could collapse the League. Evidence suggests Garhammar sold experimental weapons to both sides of conflicts, prolonging wars for profit.

## Plot Hooks

1. A guild compact quietly sells ancestral Dulgaric mines to foreign powers; exposing it risks dwarven civil war.
2. Arbitration is used to arm both sides of a looming conflict; the party must decide whether to intervene.
3. A whistleblower exposes infernal consultants rewriting charters for profit.

## DM Notes

### Using This Faction
Garhammar is capitalism without brakes. NPCs range from earnest innovators to ruthless profiteers. Show both the innovation they enable and the exploitation they cause. Let players benefit from their services while facing moral costs.

### Future Plans
A labor uprising threatens production; a client state defaults and Garhammar seizes it militarily; Dulgarum demands recompense for betrayed oaths.
