elder-001 	 elderholt;magic   	 2500    	        0	 Silniel's Transformation    	 Silniel, a deep-witch who bargained to protect Elderholt forever, walks into the center of Elderstead and roots herself. Her body transforms into the massive witch-tree that now dominates the city's heart, becoming a living conduit between the wards and the weather itself.
elder-002 	 elderholt;magic   	 3940   	        0	 Calyrix Fragments           	 Elder Calyrix strikes an unprecedented bargain to be present wherever witch-children learn. She fractures into dozens of lesser selves, each anchored to a place in Elderstead—statues, mirrors, doorframes, and teaching circles. She becomes distributed consciousness rather than a single witch.
elder-003 	 elderholt;magic   	 3200   	        0	 Raven's Lich Rite           	 Elder Raven completes her transformation into lichdom, dissolving her own body in alchemical acid to escape the Voice's toll of unbearable sensation. She rises days later as a lich with bones etched in necromantic script, having finally achieved a form that doesn't argue with her existence.
elder-004 	 elderholt;conflict	 3950    	        0	 The Underdark Purge         	 Elderholt's witches act as one in a rare unified action. Led by Kharbora and other elders, they descend into the Underdark and eliminate multiple drow matron mothers. Taramet forges a massive door to seal away a corridor to the deep unknown. The key is later lost, though Taramet seems unconcerned.
elder-005 	 elderholt;lore    	 4300    	        0	 Marrith Judges Elwen        	 Elder Marrith the Ashen Measure is forced to execute her own daughter Elwen, a deep-witch who crossed too many lines and could no longer be contained. Marrith draws a circle of pale fire that burns only inward, leaving nothing but ash. This judgment occurs when Breann (Marrith's granddaughter) was still a young Votary.
marwen-001	 elderholt;magic   	 4307   	        0	 Marwen's Rebirth            	 A young child experiences a transformative fire that destroys their male form and remakes them as female. The fire was unknowingly started by the child's own will through connection to the Voice. Breann's child survives, reborn as Marwen Ashcroft.
marwen-002	 elderholt;lore    	 4307/06	       14	 The Elder Debate            	 The Elderholt elders argue for days over whether to accept Marwen as a threadling. Boys are never taken by the coven, but the fire had already unraveled what she had been. Ishvar of Prudence actively opposes her initiation. The Axiom recognizes Marwen as its own, and she is accepted.
marwen-003	 elderholt;lore    	 4308   	        0	 Naelith's Dark Prophecy     	 Elder Naelith the Unmoored Seer speaks Marwen's name once in prophecy, foretelling great ruin and destruction. She deliberately keeps her distance from the child afterward and refuses to elaborate further on what she foresaw.
clair-001 	 elderholt;magic   	 4319   	        0	 Clair Earns Ward-Markings   	 Clair Ashcroft, daughter of Breann and older sister to Marwen, earns her first ward-markings. She demonstrates powerful Sight from an early age and follows the path of a ward-witch. Marwen watches with pride and hopes her own runes will someday be worthy of her sister's.
marwen-004	 elderholt;lore    	 4320   	        0	 Brannith's First Lesson     	 Elder Brannith the Hag begins teaching Marwen without asking permission. She has Marwen sit in a rotting doorway for hours—one foot inside Elderholt, one foot out—forcing the young witch to confront her visibility and the expectations others place on her. The lesson: "If you wait to be welcomed, you will rot in the doorway."
clair-002 	 elderholt;magic   	 4322   	        0	 Clair Becomes a Tollbearer  	 Clair Ashcroft strikes her first real bargain with the Voice and becomes a Tollbearer. She leaves Elderholt to wander the world, following the traditional path of witches who have outgrown the coven's teachings. Marwen plans to follow her sister's path toward the ruins near Ardenhaven.
marwen-005	 elderholt;lore    	 4326   	        0	 Silniel's Dream             	 Marwen receives a recurring dream about climbing to the top of the witch-tree Silniel's branches. As a child, she once tried to climb Silniel and was scolded for being disrespectful. The dream's meaning remains unclear, but it scratches at the edges of her mind.
marwen-006	 elderholt;magic   	 4327/06	        0	 Marwen Climbs the Witch-Tree	 Shortly before leaving Elderholt, Marwen uses magic to swiftly climb Silniel's branches, no longer waiting for permission from others to act. She reaches the canopy as leaves rustle and charms clatter. Silniel has secretly placed seeds on Marwen to be carried into the wider world.
marwen-007	 elderholt;lore    	 4327/07	        0	 Marrith's Crow              	 Before Marwen departs, Elder Marrith the Ashen Measure gives her a crow to travel with her. The crow is tasked with watching for corrupted witches—those who have lost themselves to the Voice. Marrith warns Marwen: if she must face such a witch, send word immediately and do not act alone.
marwen-008	 elderholt         	 4327/07	        0	 Marwen Departs Elderholt    	 Marwen Ashcroft, now 20 years old, leaves Elderholt as a threadling to wander the world. Her first destination is the ruins near Ardenhaven, where her sister Clair once traveled. She carries Marrith's crow, Silniel's hidden seeds, and the weight of Naelith's dark prophecy.
