# Witches of Elderholt

The power of Elderholt's witches comes from what they call **the Voice**. The Voice has no true name and is not worshipped as a god; it is a presence, a force, a well of hidden knowledge. Witches treat it as a dangerous tool—something to bargain with, not to venerate.

In Elderholt, a **witch** is anyone who has learned to hear the Voice and survive the conversation. Through it, they draw the secrets that let them shield villages, break curses, and bend fate. The Voice never gives freely. Every insight, every enchantment, every glimpse of the future has a cost.

At the table, that power can wear many different shapes. A witch might be built using the rules for a cleric, warlock, sorcerer, or wizard—but in principle, **any class** could be a witch if the story says they hear the Voice. A battle-scarred fighter who was tithed as a child and never showed much talent for spellcasting is still a witch; she simply lacks the training to raise wards or see what comes next. In Elderholt, witches do not pray to gods, swear pacts to named patrons, or study under mortal masters. Instead, the Voice whispers them the patterns, prayers, and bargains they need, and learning those secret ways is what takes the tax. What the Voice chooses to show each witch, and how they survive those lessons, makes every witch's magic a little different.

Witches are not self-made; they are **chosen young**. Girls who are forgotten, given up, or quietly offered to the coven are taken in and raised as witch-children. They are far too young to choose that path for themselves, so the covens test them. If a girl is judged strong in mind and will, she is taken below the city into a sealed ritual chamber the witches call **the Axiom**. The Axiom is an ancient hall of stone and sigils, deep beneath Elderstead, where the Voice is closest and most tightly bound. There, the child undergoes a binding rite that leaves no visible mark but fixes a thread between her and the Voice. From that day on, if she is trained correctly, the Voice will answer when she calls—and fall silent when she does not.

The covens insist only **children** can survive this bond intact. Young minds are flexible, still learning language and self; they can grow around the presence of the Voice without breaking. Adults who attempt the Axiom rite almost always shatter, their sense of self drowned as the Voice floods in and simply wears them like a mask. Such failures become cautionary tales, locked away or quietly unmade. After the binding, witch-children train for years in the covens above, learning to call and silence the Voice at will. Only when a novice can hold the thread steady without breaking does she attempt her first true bargain.

The safest way to touch the Voice is deep within **ancient ruins**. Those old runic halls let the Voice come through more cleanly than the open wilds. Even so, the strongest and clearest place is beneath Elderstead, where Elderholt's capital is built atop a buried, humming lattice of old wards and stones. Witches believe this site to be one of the places the Voice is loudest in the world.

By Elderholt's law and doctrine, the Tithe for witches is taken only from **girls**. Boys grow into men whose anger and pride give the Voice a sharper edge—pushing its whispers toward war and destruction. Whether that belief is truth, superstition, or convenient tradition, no coven in Elderholt will risk binding a son to the Voice.

## Witch-Children

Within the covens, witch-children of all ages move through sacred spaces as freely as any elder. They are welcome to sit in council meetings, listen to disputes, and watch rituals unfold as if they were adults. No oaths are demanded of them. No votes are taken from them. No expectations are laid upon their shoulders beyond listening and learning.

The witches believe that **all young children**—not just those bound to covens—can hear faint echoes of the Voice. A farm child might speak a strange phrase at twilight. A merchant's daughter might ask an unsettling question with no context. Most adults dismiss these moments as childish nonsense, but witches pay attention. They know the Voice sometimes touches children who have never been near the Axiom, whispering through them in ways it would never do with adults.

The reason is simple and unbreakable: **young children have no agenda**. Their wants are immediate and formless—warmth, comfort, a familiar voice. They carry no sharp ambitions to twist into bargains, no desperate needs to exploit. When a child speaks something strange, they are not *asking* the Voice for anything. They are simply an open channel, and in that unguarded state, the Voice may flow through without demanding payment in return. The child feels nothing, remembers nothing, and walks away unharmed.

But the moment intention enters the exchange, everything changes.

If a witch asks a child to seek the Voice—to pose a question, to repeat what they hear, to carry a message into the Axiom—the transaction snaps into focus. The child is no longer a passive vessel; they have been made into a petitioner. The witch's intention poisons the well. The Voice does not care that the mouth is small or that the child does not understand what they are doing. It recognizes a bargain when one is offered, and it takes its due as if the petitioner were a full-grown witch.

Every coven in Elderholt knows the stories. Children who were asked for "just one little favor" and returned hollow-eyed, their laughter gone. Children who stopped speaking entirely, or children who simply did not return at all. To use a child as a shield for your own cowardice, to hide behind their innocence to avoid the Voice's price—this is seen as one of the blackest sins a witch can commit.

Among the covens, such an act is spoken of in the same breath as murder, and judged far more harshly. It is not rage or desperation; it is calculated selfishness. The perpetrator knew the cost, knew the risk, and chose to sacrifice someone too young to consent. Those who are caught doing so are stripped of all standing, expelled from coven protections, and in many cases, dragged below to the Axiom itself. There, they are given a final choice: take poison and end their own life for the life they destroyed, or kneel and ask the Voice for judgment. The Voice, as always, answers such requests. And unlike with children, it does not answer gently.

This is why witch-children are welcomed into sacred spaces but never pressed to contribute. If a child at a council meeting blurts something strange—a fragment of prophecy, a nonsense rhyme that cuts too close, a question no one asked—it is received with absolute seriousness. It may be nothing. Or it may be the Voice, giving freely for once. Either way, no witch will ask the child to clarify, to repeat it, or to seek more. The moment you ask, you transform the gift into a transaction, and the child pays the price.

The hope is fragile and carefully guarded: that once in a great while, the Voice will choose to speak through the unguarded honesty of a child, offering one free glimpse of what is hidden—purchased not with years or blood, but with nothing at all.

## Classes, Concepts, and Wards at the Table

In rules terms, Elderholt's witches sit on top of whatever class and concept you choose. The **class** determines what kinds of spells and abilities the witch can reasonably learn; the **concept** decides which of those they actually pursue.

- A witch can be of **any class** that fits your story. A battle-scarred fighter with the Voice whispering in her ear is still a witch—she just does not qualify as a Ward-Witch if she never learns protective magic or future-sight.
- To be a **Ward-Witch** in play, the character needs access to spells or features that can plausibly represent wards and glimpses ahead: alarms, shields, divinations, anything that reads as "seeing the blow before it lands" or "turning aside what should have struck." If your sorcerer only ever learns fire and force, by choice and by theme, she is a witch—but not a Ward-Witch.
- A **Deep-Witch** can come from the same spell lists as a Ward-Witch and still fall (or leap) into the deep path. Sometimes it is a matter of talent; sometimes it is a matter of **asking for too much**.

From the Voice's perspective, every bargain has a **shape**: what you ask for, and how well you can protect yourself while you ask.

- Think of wards and sight as a kind of **rating** for how safely you can bargain. If your wards and foresight are "level 1" and you reach for a "level 3" boon, the Voice will happily give you what you asked for—and then take payment in the difference.
- That "missing protection" is where scars and transformations come from. You were only one-third shielded, so the rest has to be paid for in flesh, memory, years, or something stranger.

This means two witches with the **same class and spells** can end up on opposite paths. One plays cautiously within what her wards can bear and slowly becomes a Ward-Witch. The other uses those same spells as the barest fig leaf while she reaches far beyond them and is dragged, deal by deal, into becoming a Deep-Witch.

## Ranks Within the Coven

Although witch-children move freely through coven halls, adult witches still recognize a quiet ladder of experience and sacrifice. These ranks are not uniforms or titles shouted in public, but ways witches understand who has paid what price.

1. **Votary "Threadling"**: A witch-child who has had the thread to the Voice established, but has not yet struck a true bargain. Threadlings are devoted to the service of the coven, running errands, carrying messages, and watching every ritual with wide eyes. Their only connection to the Voice is the thin, humming line forged in the Axiom—no toll yet taken, no debt yet called in.

2. **Tollbearer**: When a witch survives her first true bargain, when the Voice has changed her in a way that cannot be undone, she becomes a Tollbearer. From that moment on, she "bears the toll" and is counted as a full sister of the coven. This is a profound rite of passage, but never a celebration. There are no feasts, no songs—only acknowledgment, respect, and the silent understanding that she has joined the line between Elderholt and everything pressing in from the dark.

3. **Hollowed**: A Hollowed witch has been reshaped by multiple bargains and barely resembles the child who first entered the Axiom. Memories, sensations, even parts of her body may have been traded away—eyes that see only futures, hands that belong half to shadows, a voice that sometimes speaks in another's cadence. Despite this, or because of it, she is stable enough for leadership, feared enough to command respect, and scarred enough to practice restraint.

4. **Elder**: Elders have survived decades of bargaining and stand as living embodiments of sacrifice. Some are monstrous to behold, others eerily untouched, wearing serenity like a mask. All of them are warnings in the shape of women—proof of how far the Voice will go if you keep asking.

Because bargains reshape witches in countless different ways, there are no official insignias, sashes, or badges to mark rank. A Tollbearer might be sent into the wider world with whatever tools or charms were on hand that day, and a Hollowed or Elder may drip with talismans and relics that feel like symbols of station. But in Elderholt, nothing is ever taken at face value: rank is measured not by what you wear, but by the toll the Voice has already taken—and what you are still willing to pay.

## The Voice's Nature

Most witches describe the Voice not as a single being, but as something that **wears familiar shapes**. To one, it speaks in the tones of a dead lover; to another, as a chorus of children; to a third, as their own voice arguing back. It is not a soul, not a ghost, and not bound to any one form. It is whatever it wishes to be—and whatever the witch most dreads or longs to hear. Their own fears and desires color how the Voice sounds to them.

Over time, the toll the Voice demands pulls witches in different directions. Broadly, two paths emerge:

1. **Ward-Witches** focus on protection and sight. They trade away pieces of themselves to see further and stand longer between their people and the dark. Their skin is etched from toes to scalp with living runes, each line a bargain struck. Constant use of future-sight leaves their eyes permanently changed—glowing a brilliant, unnatural violet, as if reflecting a light only they can see.
2. **Deep-Witches** either lack the talent for defensive wards or choose to forgo them, pursuing the deepest, darkest secrets the Voice offers. Their bodies bear the mark of every deal: limbs twisted into something half-animal, eyes replaced by ember-bright sigils, shadows that move out of step with their forms. No two "payments" look the same, but all of them are irreversible. These witches prize knowledge and power above safety, and many truly believe their sacrifice is necessary for the greater good.

To an outsider, these two kinds of witches look like they belong to entirely different orders. One group moves like living sigils of protection; the other like walking curses. Among themselves, however, they recognize one another as sisters and kin—all paying different prices, all fighting the same endless war to keep the dark at bay.

The Voice itself holds no grudges and offers no comfort. It does not hate, love, or judge. The relationship between witches and the Voice is like that between a village and a wildfire or a hurricane: utterly impersonal. The Voice does not care that witches mine it for the world's hidden knowledge. It simply takes its due. Like a wildfire that will burn anyone who steps into it, the Voice extracts its tax without malice, pity, or regret.

Before a young witch ever inks the first protective rune into their skin, they are taught the oldest rule: **you never give the Voice a name**. Names are doors and chains both. To name the Voice is to invite it closer, to let it settle into shape—and no witch in Elderholt wants it to be anything more than a distant, voiceless storm on the horizon.






### **Ward-Witch I: of Prudence**

She rearly asks the Voice for anything herself. Instead, she convinces others to do it *for everyone*. A master of coven law and softer lies, she stays impeccably within doctrine while maneuvering her sisters into bargains that conveniently advance her designs. Every toll is taken for “the greater good,” every sacrifice framed as necessary, every benefit somehow hers to direct. No rule is broken, no crime committed—only the spirit of the coven slowly bent out of shape.

Among the elders, she is joked about and quietly feared. Accusing her outright would tear the coven apart, so instead she is treated as a lesson: proof that survival within the rules can still be a kind of corruption.

### **Ward-Witch II: Up bringer**

She has never been the strongest voice in the chamber, and she has never wanted to be. Her bargines are modest, and layered through decades of restraint. She asked only for what she could safely hold, and she stopped when she had enough. The price she paid was endurance—because to teach witches, you must survive long enough to watch them make their own mistakes.

She prefers the company of witch-children, listening more than speaking, correcting gently when correction is needed. Power, to her, is not what the Voice gives you, but what you refuse to ask for. If Elderholt has endured this long, it is because someone chose to stay alive, unremarkable, and present—long enough to pass the rules on intact.

### **Ward-Witch III: The Unmoored Seer**

She bears no visible wards and no obvious tolls, which unsettles any witch of. Her foresight is so complete that she learned how to ask the Voice without ever reaching beyond her protection. The Voice took nothing—because time itself took everything instead. She no longer lives in the present. Moments arrive out of sequence, days vanish, conversations happen before or after they are meant to.

To outsiders, she seems lucid and calm. To herself, she is constantly re-orienting, asking small questions to determine *when* she is rather than where. Her guidance is invaluable and terrifying: perfectly accurate, but often early, late, or impossible to act upon. The coven listens carefully when she speaks—and prays, silently, that this is one of the moments that still matters.
