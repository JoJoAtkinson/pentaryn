# The First Witch

Elderholt teaches that the first witch was not chosen by a coven, but **touched by accident**: a child, not yet ten, who heard the Voice clearly enough to follow it. The whispers led her to the buried chamber the witches now call **the Axiom**, and there she survived the first binding—becoming the first thread in a craft that would later become the covens.

Witches repeat this story as both origin and warning, because it means the seed can still happen. It is **extremely rare**, but children under ten sometimes hear the Voice without rite or training. Most forget it as a dream.
