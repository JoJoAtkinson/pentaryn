# Elderstead

> Hidden coven-seat beneath a witch-tree’s shadow.

- Culture: Human (Elderholt — Coven Realm)
- Type: Capital city
- Faction: [Elderholt](../_overview.md)

## Description
Elderstead is a quiet, ward-heavy settlement built around an unnaturally immense tree in the central square. To outsiders it looks like a rain-rotted frontier town. To the coven, it is an anchor: the nearest safe “surface” above the Axiom below, where the Voice is loudest and the coven’s most dangerous rites are kept out of sight.

## Points of Interest
- The Witch-Tree — a living monument to bargains taken too far
- The Axiom Stair — sealed access to the buried runic chambers below
- Ward-Rings — layered boundary marks that keep Elderstead difficult to find (and harder to harm)

## Adventure Hooks
- A Threadling’s dreams begin echoing a presence from the tree’s roots—guidance without words.
- Someone breaks a ward-ring from the inside, and no one remembers doing it.
- An envoy arrives with a petition; only one witch answers… and that answer contradicts the others.
