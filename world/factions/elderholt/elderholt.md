## Elderholt

Every other faction in the region measures its strength in **tens of thousands**. Cities rise and fall on the backs of their citizenry, and generals plan wars by counting how many bodies can be marched onto the field.

Elderholt is the sole exception. Its so-called “capital” hides in a dark, resin-sour pine forest, a compact settlement built around the witch-tree—an immense oak whose roots braid through the **Axiom** deep underground. At ground level, the town presents itself as a failing frontier outpost: rain-blackened shingles patched with tar, leaning porches, a weary market square, and a central hall where visitors wait beneath careful wards, all in the shadow of an unnaturally enormous oak. Beneath the surface, the ruin opens into a deliberate lattice of chambers where the coven raies witch-children, holds council, and conducts rites far from curious eyes.

Beyond that town, Elderholt disperses into the forest. Witches live in scattered watchposts, sunken halls, and tight-knit farmsteads that double as listening stations. Counting them is nearly impossible even for their allies, but the covens keep their own ledgers. Taken together, the entire civilization numbers **no more than five hundred souls**. In quiet seasons they are spread so thin that a traveler could cross Elderholt end to end and meet no one at all.

Of those five hundred, **roughly one hundred witches** remain part of the active coven. The rest are families, caretakers, and those who have retired from the bargains. **Twelve Elder Witches** remain lucid, dangerous, and fully present. Those who have gone too far are not cast out; they are settled into what the coven gently calls retirement homes—hidden places where the wards are strongest. Threadlings and Tollbearers make regular rounds to feed, clothe, and sit with them in the quiet hours.

By any conventional measure, such a population should be irrelevant. With fewer than a hundred active witches, there are not enough bodies to hold walls, march banners, or supply an army.

**In spite of this,**

if Elderholt ever acted as one, the coven could **crush any of the factions**. That it has never done so is a matter of doctrine, not a lack of power. The witches claim no land beyond their forests, levy no tribute, and need nothing that can be taken by force. It is simpler—and safer—to let the rest of the world believe Elderholt holds nothing worth conquering.

When a faction seeks the coven’s aid, it sends **envoys** to negotiate. Petitions are presented to the whole coven in the town hall, but every witch judges the request alone. If one witch feels the need and chooses to answer, no one assumes the rest will follow. If she declines, no censure follows. The coven keeps its ledger of favors as a tangle of individual choices, not a binding treaty. It is not uncommon for an envoy to depart with a single escort while the other sisters simply watch and let the matter pass.

Only in the rarest circumstances—when a threat touches every living thing—does the coven move together. A spreading cataclysm. An existential corruption. An army whose victory would poison the land beyond recovery.

Such worldly interventions occur only a handful of times in a century, sometimes once in a generation. Each time, the result is carved into history. Stories of witches bending storms, plucking commanders from their tents, or silencing entire battle lines travel far beyond Elderholt. They are told from grandmother to grandchild, embroidered and feared—yet believed—because no matter who tells them, the same moments remain unchanged: the storm that turned at a word, the general who vanished before dawn, the army that simply stopped advancing. Details drift, names are lost, but the bones of the story never do.

That is why the witches are spoken of like nightmares: too strange to predict, too patient to bargain with, and too powerful to treat lightly. When one or two of them step out of the forest, every ruler in the region holds their breath. Those solitary women carry the weight of entire nations, and the world has learned the simplest rule of Elderholt:

**Leave the witches alone.**
