## Elder Raven the Vital Ascendant (RAY-ven)

*Lesson: The Voice can only take what it knows you value.*

### Who She Was

Raven was a Deep-Witch, drawn early and irrevocably to necromancy. Where others studied wards or prophecy, Raven sought out places saturated with death—old battlefields, plague pits, forgotten burial vaults—experimenting not with souls, but with **how bodies moved**. How little of a person was required for motion. How obedience could be separated from breath. How flesh failed long before will did.

She hated her body. Not out of vanity, but out of misalignment. It felt loud, insistent, and wrong—a constant intrusion between thought and action. From a young age, Raven treated her physical form as an inconvenience to be endured until something better could be devised.

She was deeply antisocial, avoiding councils and gatherings whenever possible. Yet as her mastery grew, something strange happened.

### What She Sacrificed

For every necromantic secret Raven drew from the Voice, her body appeared to thrive.

She grew healthier. Younger. Her skin took on a faint, luminous vitality. While other witches of her experience bore etched runes, ward-scars, altered eyes, or toll-marks--Raven remained **unmarked**.

The Voice did take a toll—but not the one anyone expected.

Raven became increasingly **visible**.

She was harder to ignore in rooms, more memorable in passing, more present no matter how quietly she behaved. Attention clung to her. Eyes followed her. Conversations circled back to her name. What others mistook for favor was, to Raven, torment. The Voice anchored her ever more firmly to the very thing she despised: her physical presence.

Among the covens, this anomaly was celebrated. Raven was named an Elder under the title **the Vital Ascendant**, a cruelly ironic moniker meant to honor her apparent freedom from consequence. Witches sought her out, desperate to learn how she had bargained so deeply without visible cost.

They did not understand that attention itself was the toll.

### The Lich Rite

Raven understood the Voice better than they did.

The Voice is powerful—but it is not omniscient. It does not read thoughts. It knows only what is spoken, what is enacted, what is revealed. It learns value through confession and consequence. And Raven had kept one truth entirely to herself: she had never intended to keep her body at all.

She learned necromancy from the Voice only as far as secrecy allowed. Up to the edge where asking further would have exposed her intent. The final truths of lichdom—the anchoring of the soul, the architecture of the phylactery—she learned without it, scavenged from forbidden texts and half-lost traditions, stitched together from errors, omissions, and fragments the Voice had never touched. Not because the Voice could not have taught her, but because to ask would have named the thing she meant to keep, and the Voice needs only a name to choose a different toll.

For her final bargain in life, Raven asked the Voice for foresight, the same knowledge Ward-Witches use to shield themselves from ruin.

The Voice answered.

Every sensation Raven felt became agony.

The weight of air crushed her lungs. Light burned. Sound fractured into knives. The brush of cloth against skin flayed her nerves raw. Pain arrived before movement, lingered after stillness, and filled every gap in between. The Voice assumed this would anchor her permanently in flesh—fix her inside the body she loathed, unable to escape it without surrendering her will.

Hands shaking violently, vision blotted by white fire, she completed the phylactery binding by memory alone. Sigils were traced incorrectly, corrected, traced again. Each breath felt like swallowing broken glass. Each heartbeat thundered loud enough to drown thought.

When the binding was complete, Raven turned to the final preparation. She had already arranged the reagents, etched the containment circle, and inscribed the last sigils along the basin’s rim. With practiced precision, she mixed the alchemical components into a corrosive bath designed not to kill, but to erase—to strip flesh from bone, blood from body, and leave nothing behind that the Voice could still claim.

There was no ritual pause. No final words.

She hurled herself forward before instinct could seize control, before the mind could recoil from what the body already knew. The alchemical acid engulfed her instantly, eating through skin and muscle in seconds. The pain—already unbearable—became something beyond description, magnified by the Voice’s toll until sensation itself collapsed into noise.

She tried not to scream.

She failed.

The scream tore itself out of her as her throat burned away, cut short as the acid filled her lungs and stripped her flesh from bone. It was not a cry for help. It was the involuntary sound of a dying nervous system being overwhelmed.

The scream carried.

Witches came running, believing Raven had misjudged a bargain, that she had finally pushed too far and broken herself. They arrived in time to see her body dissolve, to watch the last of her flesh slide from bone, to feel the magic continue long after it should have failed.

When the acid settled, there was no corpse.

Only fragments of bone at the bottom of the bath, and the phylactery, intact.

Believing her dead, the coven did what witches always do with their fallen. They gathered what remained, wrapped the bones, and committed them to the earth. There were no wards, no bindings, no precautions taken beyond respect. As far as they knew, Raven was gone.

It took days.

Bone does not rise quickly. The soul does not snap back into place like breath returning to lungs. The binding took time to settle, to root, to assert itself without flesh.

When Raven finally clawed her way back into awareness, there was no pain.

No breath.

No body to betray her.

She rose from the earth in silence, her soul intact, her flesh utterly gone. The toll the Voice had chosen no longer applied. There was nothing left for it to hurt.

Her transformation became public knowledge not through confession or declaration, but through undeniable fact.

Raven had died.

And she had come back—on her own terms.

### How She Appears Now

Raven’s lich-form is deliberate and restrained. Her bones are smooth and dark, etched with necromantic script so fine it resembles natural grain. A dim violet light burns steadily within her ribcage, where pain once lived. Her eye sockets hold faint embers—sight without sensation.

There is no decay, no stench, no excess. Her presence is finally quiet. Controlled. Distant.

For the first time, she inhabits a form that does not argue with her existence.

### Role in the Covens

Raven is one of the coven’s greatest necromancers, and when Elderholt faces existential threat, it is Raven who is called. She does not command armies so much as replace them. Dead ground answers her. Fallen enemies rise at her gesture. Sieges end not through attrition, but through inevitability. More than once, Raven has halted an advancing force alone, turning battlefields into silent, obedient bulwarks.

Raven does not train apprentices, not out of secrecy, but out of disinterest. She answers questions when asked, but never frames her knowledge as a path others should follow. Those who come to her seeking absolution, shortcuts, or permission they find none. She offers precision, not reassurance.

Raven stands watch not out of loyalty or love, but because defending Elderholt aligns with her own calculus. The land remains. The dead remain useful. And as long as threats continue to rise, so will she.

### Using Raven in Play

Raven is ideal when players believe they have found a way to outmaneuver fate.

She embodies the lesson that preparation, secrecy, and patience can circumvent even cosmic systems—but that doing so requires absolute certainty about what you are willing to lose. She forces characters to confront whether withholding truth is wisdom or hubris. 

She does not lie.

She simply proves the Voice is not all-knowing—and leaves the consequences to those still bound to breath.
