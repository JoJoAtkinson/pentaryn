# Elder Kharbora the Living Shadow (KHAR-bor-ah)

*Lesson: The price of power is yours alone to judge.*

## Who She Was

Kharbora began as a dwarven Ward-Witch, stubborn and sharp-tongued, famous for holding the line in some of Elderholt’s worst winters. She stood on walls until her feet bled, traded years of her life for unbroken wards, and never once asked another witch to shoulder a cost she could bear herself.

## What She Sacrificed

They say she traded away her sight first, so she could see only the shimmer of wards and the edges of danger. Then she gave up her reflection, so the Voice could not use her own image against her. Eventually, even her body and the light that clung to it were offered. Kharbora is now a shapeless, inky silhouette of a person with burning amber sigils where eyes should be. As cold as it is to touch her, Kharbora's demeanor is aggressive and vivid—her emotions and passions still as fierce as when she was fully dwarven.

Kharbora is a witch who sacrificed everything physical and yet retains her mind completely.

## How She Appears Now

To most, she looks like a hole in the world: a jagged shadow that moves without a source, edged in faint warding runes. Her "eyes" are twin embers of amber light, flaring brighter when she is angry or amused. Lanterns dim when she passes. Children say you can feel the cold of stone keep-walls radiating from her.

## Role in the Covens

Kharbora is opinionated and unyielding. She believes that whether a sacrifice to the Voice is worth it can only ever be decided by the witch who strikes the bargain. She despises pity and loathes those who push others to pay prices they would not pay themselves. A common fear among the wider coven is what Kharbora will sacrifice next—and whether she will still be able to stand watch if she offers up too much.

## Using Kharbora in Play

Kharbora is the elder who snarls at hesitation but refuses to make choices for others. She is ideal for scenes where a PC must decide how far they are willing to go. She will not tell them what the "right" answer is, only that they will live—or not—with what they give away.
