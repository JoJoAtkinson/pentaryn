# Elder Taramet the Forged

*Lesson: Everything you make carries a piece of you.*

## Who They Were

## What They Sacrificed

Taramet's bargain is for the work she creates to remember her. She cannot keep or use anything she makes, not even food, but everything she does carries a piece of her will and essence. Work by work she is losing her humanity but in exchange she is the one who equips the coven, carving staves of unparalleled power, shaping perfectly symmetrical cauldrons, arranging each bristle of a flying broom so it achieves optimal flight.

## How They Appear Now

A witch whose skin is like blackened steel, her veins shining gold like inlays, her joints creak faintly when she moved, and her extra set of arms are constantly fidgeting.

## Role in the Covens

Taramet's creations cannot be rushed, but when she gifts a witch a talisman, focus, or tool it will be with them the rest of their lives and be passed down to others from there. She uses her foresight to determine what is needed next from her and who will need to bear it. In a sense, she is there to help every witch through their trials.
