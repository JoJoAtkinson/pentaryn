The Wayward Witch

The Wayward Witch has many names and none. Every culture knows her, but none agree on who she is.

In human lands she is known as The Road Mother Sereth Vale. She appears as a woman of indeterminate age wearing dust-stained boots, a thick shawl around her shoulders, and too many rings. In this guise she carries The Wayfarer’s Ledger: a weathered book whose pages never quite fill and uses it to record promises and favors owed. People assume she is a widow, a pilgrim, or a courier of quiet importance. She is welcomed anywhere and children tend to follow her. Humans say she brings change. They do not agree if it is good.

In orcish lands she is Vrakka Urgnak: The One Who Does Not Stay. She appears as a broad-shouldered, scarred orc woman who carries herself like a veteran. She speaks plainly and never boasts. She is invited to fires, shares in customs, and never pretends to be one of their own. In this guise she carries The Unclaimed Blade, a dull looking shortsword that bears no clan markings and breaks bindings and cuts through barriers with use but does not pierce flesh. There is a warning not to follow her for too long lest they forget themselves. Some young orcs seek her out deliberately, hoping she will pull them away from blood feuds and inherited wars. Vrakka discourages this.

In dwarven lands she is known as Barthram-dur. She appears as a quiet, sharp-eyed dwarven woman with a talent for mechanisms. She knows doors that should not exist and understands more about their fortresses and mines than they do. Dwarves dislike her for this but often barter with her for knowledge. In this guise she carries The Ring of Borrowed Keys, a thick iron ring holding dozens of mismatched keys that can open any door, but none work twice in the same place.

In elven lands she is known as She Who Walks Between Leaves. She appears as a tall, pale woman. Her movements are graceful but incomplete, like a dance interrupted. Elves sense the wrongness immediately. She is treated with ceremonial politeness and quiet unease. They offer her formal hospitality and never leave her alone in their lands. She is not granted an elven name, she is treated almost like wandering spirit. She has no artifact in this guise, only her lack of a name, of belonging.

In Elderholt she is simply Elder Way and wears thick robes with a deep cowl that makes it impossible to look upon her face.

Each name is true, but none are complete. She does not correct anyone.

The Wayward Witch abides by several rules. She cannot keep a single name, maintain one form, or remain in one place beyond three days before moving forward. Travel feels strange around her: doorways feel deeper when she passes through, stairs gain an extra step, roads stretch ahead of her, and thresholds hesitate.

Due to the nature of her many identities, the Wayward Witch is not easily found and rarely responds to Sendings, however she is the witch most familiar with the other peoples of the world and their traditions. When the coven must move as one beyond Elderholt, The Wayward Witch is best positioned to carry that will into motion.

Please refine the concept especially for each of the other civilizations to best reflect her reputation and those respective cultures. I am more limited in what I have available in that regard and information would be limited from inside Elderholt about each of these other identities.

I was inspired by the fact that Gandalf is known as The Grey Pilgrim, to Elves as Olorin, to Dwarves as Tharkun, as Greyhame and Stormcrow in the south and yet his actual name is Mithrandir.
