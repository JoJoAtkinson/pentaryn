# Elder Brannith [Bran-ith] the Hag/Overlooked

*Lesson: Never underestimate the value of being underestimated.*

Elder Brannith is the Master of Abjuration among the deep-witches. She is collectively known as “The Hag” even though it’s not her true title.

## What They Sacrificed

The Bargain Beneath the Hag

Long ago, Brannith foresaw that the coven would need someone the Voice would underestimate. So, she made a bargain. “Let me be exactly what they believe I am.” The Voice agreed and took her from the ability to be seen as anything else. No glamor or illusion can change her body; she will always look like the worst version of a witch from a frightened child’s tale. She is exactly what others expect from her. If someone believes she is dangerous to them, then she is. If someone believes she will punish them, then punishment becomes inevitable.

However, she no longer generates surprise, has no inbuilt ambition, and triggers no curiosity from the Voice. The Voice cannot detect hunger, fear, or desire from Brannith. She has no desires sharp enough to bargain with but retains all of the magical powers of her kind because that is what is expected. As a result of this deal, divinations struggle to lock onto her, prophecies blur around her presence, and foresight cannot predict her actions.

## How They Appear Now

Brannith looks like the storybook ending of a witch: bent spine, hooked nose, yellowed eyes like old amber, knuckles swollen, fingers crooked, shawl stitched from scraps of black feathers, grave-cloth, and crow-down.

## Role in the Covens

Brannith lives at the edge of Elderholt in a leaning house where charms clatter in the wind and crows perch like punctuation marks. Outsiders whisper that she eats children. Nothing could be further from the truth. Witch-children frequently visit her and bring her offerings. Brannith simple smiles with far too-many teeth and calls them “little debts.”

Witch-children trust her because they are taught that “scary things don’t pretend to be kind” and that “punishment has rules.” Brannith never surprises them, she does exactly what she is supposed to do.

Elder Ishvar cannot stand Brannith, because she cannot regulate her and cannot effectively manipulate her. Ishvar has tried, repeatedly, to bring Brannith under control. Each attempt fails, not because Brannith resists but because she complies too literally.

If Ishvar writes a statute, Brannith follows it exactly as written and then enforces everything the statute failed to name. This exposes every flaw: Ishvar shows what the law *permits*, and Brannith immediately becomes the harsh, literal shape of those permissions.

There is an unspoken agreement in council that Ishvar speaks first and Brannith speaks last. Ishvar frames a matter in terms of doctrine and “the greater good”; Brannith then demonstrates what that doctrine looks like when enforced without mercy or interpretation. When the Hag contradicts others after that, the council listens—because they are seeing the end of the road they are about to pave.

The Hag is closest to Calyrix and may be found talking to her old friend whenever children are nearby.
