# Elder Vezrugar the Empty Vessel (VEZ-roo-gar)

*Lesson: You can give up feeling and still choose to care.*

## Who She Was

Vezrugar is an elderly orc witch who once burned hot with anger and joy in equal measure. As a young Tollbearer she was known for laughing in the face of danger and weeping openly at funerals. Her emotions were a storm that the covens both relied on and feared.

## What She Sacrificed

They say that fear was the first emotion Elder Vez surrendered, trading it for the clarity to stand firm when others flinched. Over the years, grief, joy, anger, jealousy, and even love were each given up in turn to fuel her bargains. Now she is deathly thin, and beneath her skin bright lights shine like caged stars. Silver stains mark her cheeks like tattoos, the visible record of each feeling surrendered.

Her voice is steady, incapable of wavering. Her eyes shine with cold logic. And yet, one of her gifts is the ability to **see** emotions. She reads heartbreak, fear, excitement, and pity as easily as one reads a book, even if she does not feel any of it herself.

Vez is Kharbora’s opposite: a witch whose sacrifices were more of the mind than of the body.

## How She Appears Now

Up close, Vezrugar looks like a lantern made of skin and bone. Light leaks through her ribs when she breathes. Her silver cheek-marks glimmer faintly when someone nearby feels something strongly. Witch-children whisper that if you stand in her shadow while lying, the light under her skin flickers.

## Role in the Covens

Witch-children are afraid of her; she comes across as so alien and unreadable. Yet Elder Vez spends much of her time with witches who are growing into their womanhood, guiding, counseling, and shaping them through their struggles. She cannot feel their pain, but she can see it, name it, and help them decide what to do with it.

## Using Vezrugar in Play

Vezrugar is perfect for hard conversations and quiet scenes. She can tell a PC exactly what they are feeling and how sharply—without judgment or comfort. Her presence pushes players to articulate what they want and what they are willing to lose, knowing she will not flinch or soften the truth.
