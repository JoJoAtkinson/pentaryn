## Who They Were

[Origin, culture, and the “before” version of the Elder. What did they value? What role did they play in Elderholt?]

## What They Sacrificed

[What did the Voice take (or what did they offer)? What changed first, and what did it cost them over time?]

## The Turning Point / Rite (Optional)

[If there was a defining bargain, catastrophe, or transformation (lich rite, binding, exile, apotheosis), put it here.]

## How They Appear Now

[Present-day description: silhouette, markings, voice, presence, and how others react to them.]

## Role in the Covens

[What do they do as an Elder? What are they known for? Who fears them, who respects them, and why?]

## Using <Name> in Play

[DM notes: what kinds of scenes they create, what hard choice they force, what they can offer the party (and at what cost).]
