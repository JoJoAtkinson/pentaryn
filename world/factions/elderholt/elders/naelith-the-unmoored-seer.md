# Elder Naelith the Unmoored Seer

*Lesson: The Voice can take nothing—because time itself can take everything instead.*

## Who They Were

## What They Sacrificed

Her foresight is so complete that she learned how to ask the Voice without ever reaching beyond her protection. The Voice took nothing—because time itself took everything instead. She no longer lives in the present. Moments arrive out of sequence, days vanish, conversations happen before or after they are meant to.

## How They Appear Now

She bears no visible wards and no obvious tolls, which unsettles any witch of age. To outsiders, she seems lucid and calm.

## Role in the Covens

To herself, she is constantly re-orienting, asking small questions to determine *when* she is rather than where. Her guidance is invaluable and terrifying: perfectly accurate, but often early, late, or impossible to act upon.

## Using Naelith in Play

The coven listens carefully when she speaks—and prays, silently, that this is one of the moments that still matters.
