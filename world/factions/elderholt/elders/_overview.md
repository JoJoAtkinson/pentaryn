# Elder Titles and Monikers

To survive long enough to become an **Elder** is one of the highest honors in Elderholt. Every bargain with the Voice is a roll of weighted dice, and most witches never grow old. The title "Elder" marks those who have endured not just years, but decades of sacrifice.

Among witches, earned monikers and titles end up far more important than surnames. Family is not the focus in Elderholt; what you sacrificed, and what you became, says far more about who you are. "Living Shadow," "Empty Vessel," "Tithe-Bearer"—these are not nicknames but histories, written in flesh and fate.

Such titles are meant to be feared, revered, and, most of all, respected.
