# Elder Calyrix the Many-Minded (Kal-ih-riks)

*Lesson: The greatest danger to witches is not the Voice, but isolation.*

**Domain:** Witch-children, memory  
**Magic:** Abjuration

## Who They Were

Calyrix was once a singular woman who believed the greatest danger to witches was not the Voice, but isolation. She watched generations of witch-children fail for the same reasons: loneliness, secrecy, and the dangerous belief that no one was watching when the Voice whispered too sweetly.

## What They Sacrificed

She made an unprecedented bargain: ”Let me be present wherever they learn to become witches.”

Calyrix fractured into dozens of lesser selves, each anchored to a place where witch-children dwell in Elderstead: dormitories, training halls, kitchens, gardens, even the tunnels near the Axiom. Each fragment holds a portion of her will, temperament, and memory. None are fully her. She is no longer a single consciousness; she is a distributed presence. One Calyrix is gentle and patient, another is sharp and corrective, a third is distant and unsettling. They speak of one another in the third person.

## How They Appear Now

Now Calyrix exists as statues in courtyards and halls, mirrors that briefly reflect a woman who is not the viewer, carved reliefs in stairwells that whisper corrections, doorframes that murmur warnings at night, and teaching circles where her voice answers before a question is asked. Each anchor holds a facet of her: patience, discipline, humor, severity, tenderness. No single anchor remembers everything. Witch-children learn quickly: if you talk to the walls long enough, Calyrix answers.

## Role in the Covens

She sees patterns no single witch could: which children isolate themselves, which rivalries turn dangerous, which lessons break spirits instead of building them. Her magic is almost entirely ward-based, subtle, preventative. Doors lock when they should, runes flicker a warning just in time, a child changes their mind and never knows why.

Witch-children treat her like a strange, omnipresent aunt. They leave notes in mirror corners, apologize to statues after shouting, and whisper secrets to carves animals in the walls. They do not find her frightening; she has always been there.

When council meetings are called, all of Calyrix will assemble as a consensus self, but even then she speaks in the plural. When a part of her crumbles through time or destruction, she rebalances, but a part of her is forever lost. She has not been whole in centuries and according to older witches, Calyrix is growing more abstract, her responses slower, less emotionally nuanced.

## Using Calyrix in Play

If a witch invokes a desire of quiet, speaking a simple phrase acknowledging responsibility, then Calyrix will go dormant, leaving the witch only with the Voice. She will only violate this if a witch attempts to use a child for a bargain, a bargain threatens Elderholt’s security, or the request is used to conceal harm to others.

Calyrix cannot keep secrets from herself, selectively forget, or lie convincingly. It makes her predictable but also trustworthy.
