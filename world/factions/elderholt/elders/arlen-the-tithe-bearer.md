# Elder Arlen the Tithe-Bearer (AR-len)

*Lesson: One sin can be answered with a lifetime of choosing better.*

## Who She Was

Elder Arlen began as the product of a sin. Her mother used her as a shield in a bargain, offering Arlen’s life and soul to the Voice to escape a price she herself refused to pay. The rite twisted and damaged the child; her body was saved, but her soul was forever scarred. Somehow, Arlen survived the Axiom and grew into adulthood, carrying that original wound like a hairline crack through glass.

## What She Sacrificed

As a grown witch, Arlen did the unthinkable: she volunteers to pay the price for others whenever another witch faces a toll too steep—a shattered limb, a stolen voice, a mind-splintering vision. Each time, she steps forward and says, "Take it from me instead."

At this point, Arlen is misshapen, a collage of a hundred different bargains. One arm is made of bonded branches dripping with ink, one eye a molten rune like a cracked lantern. Her shadow walks with a limp from a curse she absorbed. Her lungs whistle with frost. Her heartbeat crackles as light that sometimes shines through her skin.

## How She Appears Now

Despite the chaos of her body, Arlen remains upright and warm. Her smile is lopsided but genuine; her touch is steady. Children and witch-children alike find themselves instinctively trusting her, even as they flinch from the shifting, impossible shapes she carries.

## Role in the Covens

Arlen is merciful in a place that rarely has room for mercy. She does not erase consequences—those who try to use her as a shield the way her mother did find her anger is still very much intact. But when a witch has done everything right and the price is still cruel, Arlen is there to step between them and the Voice.

## Using Arlen in Play

Arlen is the elder who offers the party a way out—at a cost they may not want someone else to pay. She is ideal for moments when a character is about to lose something core to themselves, and you want to ask: *Will you let someone who has already been broken take this one too?* Her presence turns every bargain into a moral choice, not just a mechanical one.
