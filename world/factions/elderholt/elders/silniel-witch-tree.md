# Silniel (SILL-nee-el) — The Witch-Tree of Elderstead

In Elderholt, every witch pays a price to the Voice. Silniel is what it looks like when that price is taken **all the way to the roots**.

In the very heart of **Elderstead**, an unnaturally large tree rises from the cobbles—a towering shape of living wood and tangled branches, its bark carved and painted with **witch-marks, blessings, and offerings**. Birds nest in its boughs. Lanterns hang from its limbs. Ribbons, bones, and charms sway whenever the wind passes through the city.

To outsiders, this is **the Witch-Tree**, a holy symbol or even a goddess of Elderholt. To the covens, she is something far stranger and far more intimate:

> Silniel is a witch.
> She is also a tree.
> And those two truths do not contradict.

## Who Silniel Was

Long before her transformation, Silniel (SILL-nee-el) was counted among the **Deep-Witches**—those who forgo simple wards and protections to chase the deepest secrets the Voice offers. Where Ward-Witches trade years, scars, and sanity for shields and sight, Deep-Witches bargain for **answers**.

Silniel’s bargains all circled the same question:

> “How do we keep Elderholt safe **forever**?”

She asked for knowledge of storms and seasons, of droughts and floods, of the old lattice of stone and sigils beneath the city. Each time the Voice answered, it asked for more of her in return: flesh, voice, movement, memory. She gave them up, one piece at a time.

In the end, she asked for a power no witch had ever dared to claim:
to shape the **weather of the world**, if only slightly—enough to blunt the worst winters, steer the worst storms, and turn aside the hungriest droughts from Elderholt’s fields.

The Voice accepted.

## The Transformation

Silniel walked into the center of Elderstead and sat down in the bare, packed earth of the square. Witches gathered, expecting a final rite, a great warding, a storm called or dismissed.

Instead, Silniel **put her last bargin to the Voice**.

Witnesses say she did not scream. She simply **rooted**.

Her legs sank into the soil. Her spine arched and split. Fingers elongated into branches; hair became a canopy of leaves. Skin hardened, cracked, and darkened into bark. Her last elven breath exhaled as a warm wind that rolled over the covens and the watching crowds.

When it was done, Silniel’s body was gone. In its place stood the tree that now dominates the city’s heart.

## What Silniel Does Now

Silniel does not speak. She has no face, no mouth, no visible eyes. She is not a dryad, not a spirit that steps out to talk, and not a god that answers prayers aloud.

And yet:

- **Storms break** more often on the hills before they reach Elderholt.
- **Droughts ease** just enough when harvests are on the edge of failing.
- **Blights and early frosts** that should have ruined entire seasons falter at the city’s wards and die back.

The covens are convinced: Silniel’s sacrifice changed something.
She is a **living conduit** between Elderstead, the ancient wards beneath it, and whatever currents of air, water, and light the Voice allowed her to touch.

On **clear, gentle days**, witches leave offerings at her roots:

- Braided cords of hair
- Scrimshawed bone charms
- Bowls of clean water or fresh grain
- Carved sigils of thanks burned into small pieces of wood

They speak softly to her, not as worshippers to a goddess, but as **sisters** to one of their own.

## Mistaken Divinity

Outsiders almost always misunderstand.

Travelers and pilgrims see the Witch-Tree, the offerings, and the way witches bow their heads in her shadow, and they assume:

- Silniel is **Elderholt’s patron goddess**
- The covens **worship the tree** as a living idol
- The tree itself is the source of Elderholt’s magic

The witches correct this only rarely.They will say, if pressed:

> “She is not our god.
> She is our **sister** who paid more than any of us.”

Among themselves, the covens are careful never to call Silniel a deity.They call her:

- **Silniel-of-Roots**
- **Our Weather-Sister**
- **The Last Deep Branch**

## Silniel and the Witch Paths

Silniel stands as a living reminder of both major witch paths:

### For Ward-Witches

- She is the **reason** Elderholt’s wards can be as strong as they are.
- Many Ward-Witches believe their city’s protections rest on a bargain Silniel made on their behalf.
- Some trace protective sigils that echo leaf-veins and root-patterns, invoking her sacrifice in their work.

### For Deep-Witches

- She is the **most dangerous example** of what happens when you never stop asking the Voice for more.
- Deep-Witches see in her both a triumph and a warning:
  - *You can change the world*
  - *You may not get to stay in it the way you planned*

Some Deep-Witches leave offerings not for help, but as a promise:

> “I know the path I walk.
> When the Voice takes me, let it be for something that matters as much as you.”

## Silniel in Play (DM Notes)

- **Role in the story:**

  - Silent witness to major events in Elderstead.
  - Place for visions, omens, or weather-related miracles.
  - Anchor for big ritual scenes (especially involving climate, seasons, or city-wide wards).
- **How witches talk about her:**

  - Calm, respectful, never in tones of worship.
  - Like speaking of a retired general or a beloved elder—someone who has already given everything.
- **How players might interact:**

  - Leave offerings to ask for **subtle weather shifts** or **eased travel conditions**.
  - Seek visions or dreams after sleeping at her roots.
  - Learn from the covens that she was once a witch like them—and that the Voice can demand such a price again.

Silniel is not there to hand out answers.
She is there to remind every witch—and every player—that the Voice always has **one more bargain** to offer, and there is always one more step you can take, if you are willing to give up enough of yourself.
