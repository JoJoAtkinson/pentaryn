## What Elderholt Is (And Isn’t)

Every other faction in the region measures its strength in **tens of thousands**. Cities rise and fall on the backs of their citizenry, and generals plan wars by counting how many bodies can be marched onto the field.

Elderholt is the sole exception. Its so-called “capital” hides in a dark, resin-sour pine forest, a compact settlement built around the witch-tree—an immense oak whose roots braid through the **Axiom** deep underground. At ground level, the town presents itself as a failing frontier outpost: rain-blackened shingles patched with tar, leaning porches, a weary market square, and a central hall where visitors wait beneath careful wards, all in the shadow of an unnaturally enormous oak. Beneath the surface, the ruin opens into a deliberate lattice of chambers where the coven raises witch-children, holds council, and conducts rites far from curious eyes.

Beyond that town, Elderholt disperses into the forest. Witches live in scattered watchposts, sunken halls, and tight-knit farmsteads that double as listening stations. Counting them is nearly impossible even for their allies, but the covens keep their own ledgers. Taken together, the entire civilization numbers **no more than five hundred souls**. In quiet seasons they are spread so thin that a traveler could cross Elderholt end to end and meet no one at all.

Of those five hundred, **roughly one hundred witches** remain part of the active coven. The rest are families, caretakers, and those who have retired from the bargains. **Twelve Elder Witches** remain lucid, dangerous, and fully present. Those who have gone too far are not cast out; they are settled into what the coven gently calls retirement homes—hidden places where the wards are strongest. Threadlings and Tollbearers make regular rounds to feed, clothe, and sit with them in the quiet hours.

By any conventional measure, such a population should be irrelevant. With fewer than a hundred active witches, there are not enough bodies to hold walls, march banners, or supply an army.

**In spite of this,** if Elderholt ever acted as one, the coven could **crush any of the factions**. That it has never done so is a matter of doctrine, not a lack of power. The witches claim no land beyond their forests, levy no tribute, and need nothing that can be taken by force. It is simpler—and safer—to let the rest of the world believe Elderholt holds nothing worth conquering.

## The Source of Power

Elderholt’s witches bargain with **the Voice**—a nameless presence treated as a force, not a deity. The Voice is loudest beneath Elderstead, in the buried runic chamber called **the Axiom**, where witches are bound to it young and trained to survive its lessons.

Two paths define most witches:

- **Ward-Witches:** protection, sight, and endurance; living runes and long vigilance.
- **Deep-Witches:** pursuit of deeper secrets and transformations; power that shows its cost in body and shadow.

## How Elderholt Grows

Elderholt does not draft an army and does not rule “villages” the way a human realm does. Witches are taken in young—girls who are forgotten, surrendered, or quietly offered to the coven—and raised as **threadlings**. When they outgrow the coven’s teachings, many leave for a time, returning only when the Voice (or the world) grows too loud to face alone.

## Dealing With Outsiders

When a faction seeks Elderholt’s aid, it sends envoys to petition. There are no simple treaties. Favors are personal, case-by-case choices. A single witch may answer and the rest may watch; only existential threats bring the coven to act as one.
