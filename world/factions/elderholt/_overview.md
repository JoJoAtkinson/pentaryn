## Symbol & Colors

**Symbol:** A black cauldron wreathed in thorns beneath three moons
**Colors:** Black, deep purple, silver
**Motto/Slogan:** "Protection demands sacrifice."

## Mission & Goals

### Public Goals

Protect the realm from monsters, curses, and supernatural disasters through the Tithe system; train witches as guardians and ritual-keepers.

### True Goals

TODO: Update True Goals

Maintain the coven system's power through generational control; ensure compliance via the Tithe's emotional leverage; suppress investigations into whether covens redirect or create threats to justify their authority.

### Methods

TODO: Update True Goals

The Tithe (mandatory child conscription), ritual wards maintained by witch-circles, public protections that create dependency, exile or silencing of dissidents, education emphasizing duty over choice.

## History

### Foundation

Born during the Age of Plagues, when villages swore the Warding Compact: give children to train as witches, or face annihilation by monsters and curses.

### Major Events

- **The Warding Compact (Year TBD):** First Tithe agreed upon; High Coven established.
- **The Silent Year (Year TBD):** A village refused the Tithe; it was destroyed by curses—or by the covens as an example.
- **The Living Ward Revelation (Year TBD):** Proof emerged that some Tithed children become permanent ritual anchors, neither free nor dead.

### Current Situation

Effective and terrifying. Villages are genuinely protected; monsters rarely breach the wards. But the Tithe tears families apart, and whispers grow that covens manipulate or even summon threats to justify their power. Some return as protectors; many never do.

## Leadership Structure

### Hierarchy

The Witch-Queen leads the High Coven; regional covens govern districts; village wise-women enforce compliance.

```
Witch-Queen
    ↓
High Coven (13 Elders)
    ↓
Regional Covens (3-7 witches each)
    ↓
Village Wise-Women & Ward-Keepers
```

### Key Leaders

#### The Witch-Queen (Name TBD)

- **Title:** Sovereign of the High Coven
- **Role:** Final authority on Tithe allocation, ward policy, and coven law
- **Description:** Ageless, with eyes that see through lies; rumored to have sacrificed her own name in a binding

#### High Archivist (Name TBD)

- **Title:** Keeper of the Tithe Ledgers
- **Role:** Records all Tithed children; tracks returns, deaths, and "living wards"
- **Description:** Cold efficiency; knows every name; haunted by the numbers

## Membership

### Requirements

Birth in Elderholt; survival of the Tithe lottery (or being chosen); oaths to the Warding Compact.

### Ranks & Titles

1. **Tithed Child:** Conscripted youth undergoing training
2. **Village Citizen:** Adult who survived or was spared the Tithe
3. **Wise-Woman:** Village-level witch or ward-keeper
4. **Coven Sister:** Full member of a regional coven
5. **High Coven Elder:** Member of the Witch-Queen's inner circle

### Benefits

Protection from monsters and curses, access to healing and divination, communal resources, certainty of safety.

### Obligations

Surrender children to the Tithe, obey coven edicts, maintain ward-sites, report suspicious activity, accept the system without question.

## Resources & Assets

### Financial

- **Treasury:** Moderate; funded by village tithes (goods and labor)
- **Income Sources:** Healing services, curse-breaking fees, ritual components, village tributes

### Military

- **Forces:** Witch-warriors (combat coven members), Ward-Beasts (summoned protectors)
- **Equipment:** Ritual implements, enchanted staves, protective talismans

### Magical

- **Spellcasters:** High density; covens specialize in abjuration, necromancy, divination
- **Artifacts:** The Tithe Ledgers (binding records), Warding Stones (permanent wards), The Blackened Cauldron (High Coven focus)

### Political

- **Influence:** Absolute within borders; feared by neighbors
- **Alliances:** Grudging trade with Merrowgate; isolation from other factions

## Locations

### [Headquarters — Elderstead](../locations/elderstead.md)

High Coven seat; tithe archives and warding stones dominate the skyline.

### Regional Coven-Holds

Fortified ritual sites where covens train Tithed children and maintain wards.

### Territory

Mist-shrouded forests, hill villages, and warded borders; protected but oppressive.

## Allies & Enemies

### Allies

- **[Merrowgate](./merrowgate.md):** Trade for rare ritual components (Merrowgate doesn't judge)

### Rivals

- Internal factions debating Tithe reform vs. tradition

### Enemies

- Villages that resist the Tithe; external powers seeking to "liberate" Elderholt; dissidents exposing coven manipulation

## Reputation

### Among Common Folk (Inside)

Grim acceptance. The Tithe is horror, but monsters are worse. Most believe it's necessary.

### Among Common Folk (Outside)

Child-stealers and dark witches; feared and avoided.

### Among Other Factions

Effective but morally repugnant; useful for curse-breaking; avoided for alliances.

## Activities & Operations

### Public Activities

Ward maintenance, Tithe ceremonies, monster patrols, healing services.

### Secret Operations

Redirecting or summoning minor threats to justify the Tithe; converting Tithed children into "living wards" (ritual anchors); silencing dissidents; investigating villages that question the system.

### Current Projects

Expanding ward coverage to justify increased Tithe quotas; suppressing evidence of living wards.

## Quests & Involvement

### Quests Offered

- Investigate a ward failure threatening a village; uncover sabotage or siphon issues.

### Related Quests

- A village petitions to end the Tithe; the wards immediately begin failing.

## Player Faction Reputation

| Character | Rank | Reputation | Notes |
| --------- | ---- | ---------- | ----- |
|           |      |            |       |

### Reputation Effects

- **Friendly (25+):** Access to coven healing, ward protections, exemption considerations
- **Neutral (0-24):** Standard protections; Tithe obligations enforced
- **Hostile (-25 to -1):** Marked as dissidents, wards withheld, potential exile or worse

## Secrets & Mysteries

Some covens do redirect or summon minor threats to justify their power. Living wards exist—Tithed children transformed into permanent ritual anchors, neither alive nor dead, sustaining the protections. The Witch-Queen may be bound to an ancient entity that demands the Tithe as payment.

## Plot Hooks

1. A ledger discrepancy reveals a hidden class of "living wards" maintained in sealed chambers.
2. A village refuses the Tithe; the wards fail immediately—too quickly to be natural.
3. A returned Tithed child begs the party to expose what the covens truly do to those who "never come back."

## DM Notes

### Using This Faction

Elderholt is morally complex horror. The protections are real; the cost is unbearable. NPCs range from grieving parents to zealous witches to conflicted coven members. Players should face the question: is ending the Tithe worth the risk?

### Future Plans

A coven splinter faction seeks to end the Tithe and reveal the living wards; the Witch-Queen orders a purge; a village uprising forces the party to choose sides.
