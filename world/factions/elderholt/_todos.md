I think plenty of witches have left Elderholt over the centuries. Not droves, but one here, one there. Some to retire in other communities. Others did become monsters. The strength of them varies depending on what they became but I think elders are still, generally, more powerful. Most of the elders have the Voice or an equivalent power. A deep-witch who lost herself doesn't. She arguably has nothing left to bargain with.

I think the other important theme to touch on are those rogue witches are alone, they have no coven. It's not another tradition, but women who became monsters. Some for the right reasons, some for the wrong ones.
