# Mara Ardenholt — “Centipede”

*A lost Deep-Witch whose bargains left her with a human face and a centipede body—terrifying to meet, but more roleplay than a straight fight.*

## Who She Was

Mara Ardenholt was coven-raised: a Threadling bound in the Axiom, trained properly, and clever enough to become a Tollbearer without immediately shattering. She was never built for wards. Where her sisters learned patience and protection, Mara learned **reach**: the kind of questions that make the Voice answer with a knife.

She left Elderholt on an “errand” that never ended: a pilgrimage into old ruins where the Voice comes through cleanly. The coven has no record of her return. They assume she died, went feral, or was quietly unmade somewhere they couldn’t find.

## What She Asked For (And What the Voice Took)

Mara wanted control—over fear, over fate, over the tremor in a hand before a mistake, over the moment a person decides to betray you.

In the ruins, she asked the Voice for a way to **hold the world still** long enough to understand it.

The Voice answered. It gave her a body made for stillness and waiting: a centipede’s patience, a hundred points of contact with stone, and a sense for vibration so fine she can “hear” footsteps like speech.

Then it collected payment in what she used to be—the difference between what she asked for and what her wards could safely bear.

## How She Appears Now

Mara’s **human head** is set at the front of an enormous centipede body, as if her neck simply kept going and became segmented chitin. Her face is recognizably human—cheeks, lips, lashes—but the skin around her jaw is webbed through with faint, ink-dark sigils that pulse when the Voice is near.

Behind her, the centipede body is long enough that you never see all of it at once in tight corridors. The segments are the color of wet bark and old bone. Every so often, a segment bears a scar where a rune was carved into chitin and healed wrong.

Her eyes don’t match. One is a normal human brown. The other reflects light wrong—violet, like a ward-witch’s stare, but fractured as if a cracked lens sits under the iris.

### Her Legs (And How She “Uses Her Hands”)

Mara’s first six legs—three pairs closest behind her head—are wrong for a centipede:

- They are **longer**, jointed like arms, and end in hooked, finger-like tips that can gently clamp without crushing.
- They are stained with wax, soot, and ink from years of handling relics and pressing sigils.
- When she wants to “pick something up,” she doesn’t pinch like a crab; she **wraps** two or three of those forelegs around an object, braces it against her body, then sets it down with careful, ritual precision.

The rest of her legs are faster and more animal: made for climbing, clinging, and vanishing into cracks. When she moves, it sounds like soft rain on leaves.

### Her Voice

She speaks out loud, but not always alone.

- In calm moments, she uses **“I”** and remembers manners.
- When the Voice presses close, she slips into **“we”**, answers questions you didn’t ask, and smiles like she’s listening to someone behind you.
- Sometimes her mouth speaks a sentence and her legs “finish it” with a tapping rhythm, like punctuation.

## Her Madness (How to Play Her)

Mara is not stupid. She is **splintered**.

- She argues with unseen speakers, then turns and apologizes to empty air.
- She forgets time in chunks and treats the present like a scene she’s already watched.
- She becomes fixated on patterns: counting footsteps, aligning objects, finishing sentences “correctly.”
- She can be terrifyingly lucid for a single line—then lose the thread completely and start over.

She is scary because she is **wrong**, and because she can take control of a moment without drawing blood.

## The Ruins — Mara’s Chamber

Mara nests in an old runic hall: the kind of place witches seek because the Voice comes through cleaner than it does in open wilds. Parts of the ruin have collapsed into cave-like passages, and the stone is always damp as if it’s breathing.

> The corridor widens into a broken hall. Carved runes crawl across fallen pillars like dried veins. The air tastes faintly of ash and old ink. Somewhere ahead, something moves—soft, many-footed, careful—like rain deciding where to fall.

### Layout (Simple, Playable)

1. **The Descent**
   - A cracked stair or sinkhole drop into darkness.
   - The walls show old, careful repairs… and newer scratches that look like tally marks.

2. **The Listening Threads**
   - Strands of hair-thin cord and waxed twine crisscross ankle height.
   - They’re not traps meant to kill—just an alarm net. When disturbed, they make a faint chime like glass under a wet finger.

3. **The Archive Nest**
   - A ring of objects arranged in spirals: spoons, buttons, keys, teeth, small bones, bits of ribbon, broken holy symbols.
   - Everything is placed at “hand height” for her forelegs: on flat stones, ledges, and a toppled altar used like a desk.
   - Some items are labeled in neat Common; others are labeled in frantic scrawl that trails off mid-word.

4. **The Chamber Proper (Her “Desk”)**
   - A cracked stone dais with a shallow groove around the edge, like a ritual circle.
   - Melted candle stubs and ink bowls wedged into the groove.
   - A single chair sits facing the dais—human-sized, dusty, unused—like she keeps forgetting she can’t sit in it anymore.

5. **The Crackways**
   - Hairline fractures and collapsed side tunnels only she can easily use.
   - If things go badly, she retreats through these, leaving the party with whispering stone and unanswered questions.

### What Makes It Feel Corrupted

- **Sigils carved into everything**: stone, bone, chitin, rusted metal—none of them consistent.
- **Half-finished bargains**: circles that are almost complete, offerings placed wrong, names scratched out.
- **A human life preserved badly**: a mirror with spiderweb cracks, a comb, a child’s wooden toy, all arranged like shrine pieces.
- **The Voice in the air**: when characters speak, the ruin sometimes repeats a word back later, softly, in Mara’s cadence.

### What’s Found In Her “Home”

Most of what Mara keeps is not treasure. It is evidence: of bargains attempted, of control sought, of a life she can’t quite remember in the right order.

**Objects and Features**

- **The Spiral Archive:** dozens of small items arranged by a logic only she understands (keys, teeth, buttons, coins, ring fragments, broken holy symbols). Some are tagged with neat Common labels; others have frantic labels that stop mid-word.
- **The Ink-Groove:** the dais’ shallow ritual groove is stained black with years of “correcting” circles. Touching it leaves a faint numbness in fingertips for a few minutes (harmless, unsettling).
- **A Mirror That Isn’t For Vanity:** a cracked hand mirror propped to face the empty chair. The back is carved with tally marks and one repeated name: “Mara,” in different handwritings.
- **Bone-Chimes and Thread Traps:** cords, twine, and hair-thin wire strung low; tiny bone chips or glass beads act as chimes. They’re alarms, not weapons.
- **Chitin Scraps:** shed plates and slivers, kept like fingernail clippings. Some have runes scratched into them, as if she’s testing whether the Voice can be “written” into her new body.
- **Offerings Gone Wrong:** bowls of ash, dried berries, a rusted knife, a cracked teacup, a child’s ribbon—items placed as if mid-ritual and then abandoned.

**Witchcraft Clues**

- **A half-map of ruins:** charcoal marks on stone showing corridors that don’t match the real layout; a second layer drawn over it, corrected again and again, as if the ruin keeps “moving” in her memory.
- **A bargain ledger (fragmentary):** loose scraps of paper with short, clinical lines like “Asked: stillness. Paid: …” where the payment is scratched out. Some lines end with a centipede-leg tapping pattern described in text: “tap-tap—tap.”
- **A warning written for strangers:** a clear sentence on a clean piece of slate: “DO NOT NAME IT. DO NOT THANK IT.” (then, below, a dozen contradictory addenda in smaller handwriting).

**Useful Things For PCs**

- **A safe place to talk:** the empty chair and the dais are the one spot where Mara is most likely to hold a conversation without circling or hiding—if the party sits, stays still, and speaks plainly.
- **A single “clean” charm:** a simple cord charm (waxed twine, a nail, a knot) that functions as a one-time ward against being surprised (flavor; treat as advantage on one initiative roll, then it snaps).
- **A clue outward:** one spiral includes a fresh item that doesn’t belong (a recently minted coin, a modern button, a scrap of paper with a current name). It implies someone else has been here, recently—either feeding her, studying her, or using her as a tool.

## Using Mara in Play

### First Contact

She does not rush. She lets the party get deep enough that leaving feels like giving up.

Good opening beats:
- She speaks from the dark without showing herself: “Don’t step there. That stone remembers.”
- She finishes a PC’s sentence with perfect accuracy—then asks who taught them that line.
- She offers a choice that sounds kind but isn’t: “Sit. Or stand. Either way, be still.”

### If the Party Pushes Her

Mara won’t try to kill them. She disables, frightens, confuses, and escapes:
- She separates the group with illusion and darkness.
- She freezes the most aggressive target.
- She makes the brave feel watched, and the quiet feel *heard*.

## Mechanics (Optional) — Level 6 Control Witch

If you need numbers, run Mara as a **6th-level spellcaster** built for control and horror, not damage.

### Suggested Spellcasting

**Spellcasting Ability:** Intelligence (save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks)  
**Theme Rule:** No direct-damage spells prepared; control/illusion/warding only.

**Cantrips (at will):** `friends`, `mage hand`, `message`, `minor illusion`, `prestidigitation`  

**1st level (4 slots):** `charm person`, `disguise self`, `grease`, `silent image`, `sleep`  

**2nd level (3 slots):** `detect thoughts`, `hold person`, `suggestion`, `web`  

**3rd level (3 slots):** `fear`, `hypnotic pattern`, `major image`, `slow`  

### Body Notes (Centipede)

- She can climb stone like it’s flat ground.
- Her forelegs count as “hands” for manipulating objects and performing somatic components.
- If you want a nonlethal “attack,” give her a **numbing bite** that deals minimal damage and imposes a control condition (slowed, restrained, or paralyzed) instead of poison death.
