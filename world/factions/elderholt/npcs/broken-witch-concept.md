# Broken Witch — Concept Development

**Type:** Deep-Witch (Fallen/Broken)  
**Status:** Too far gone, but still present enough to refrain from murder  
**Threat Level:** Extreme (terrifying, evil, corrupted, insane)

---

## Concept Questions

Rate each aspect from **a** (none at all) to **e** (take it to the next level):

### 1. **Physical Transformation — How monstrous does she look?**

**a) None at all:** She appears completely normal, no visible signs of corruption.

**b) Subtle:** Minor changes—eyes slightly wrong color, fingers a bit too long, shadow doesn't quite match.

**c) About right:** Clearly inhuman. Parts of her body are warped: one arm is shadowy/translucent, face partially replaced by sigils that glow, skin cracked like old pottery revealing something underneath.

**d) More:** Barely recognizable as human. Multiple limbs replaced or transformed, body half-merged with shadow/plant matter/something ancient, voice comes from multiple mouths.

**e) Next level:** A walking nightmare. Her form shifts constantly, pieces of different creatures/elements fused together, reality bends around her presence, looking at her too long causes nausea or hallucinations.

---

### 2. **Mental State — How broken is her mind?**

**a) None at all:** Perfectly lucid, fully in control of all her faculties.

**b) Subtle:** Occasional lapses—forgets conversations mid-sentence, refers to people who aren't there, but mostly coherent.

**c) About right:** Clearly insane. Talks to the Voice out loud, laughs at nothing, has moments of terrifying clarity followed by confusion. Knows she's broken and occasionally mourns it.

**d) More:** Multiple personalities/voices arguing inside her head, no consistent sense of time, treats the party like they're characters in a story she's watching unfold.

**e) Next level:** Reality itself seems negotiable to her. She doesn't distinguish between past/present/future, speaks in prophecy and riddles, her madness feels contagious—prolonged exposure makes others question their own sanity.

---

### 3. **The Voice's Influence — How much control does the Voice have over her?**

**a) None at all:** She severed her connection completely; the madness comes from withdrawal.

**b) Subtle:** The Voice whispers occasionally, but she can still resist most of the time.

**c) About right:** The Voice talks through her frequently. Sometimes it's her speaking, sometimes it's clearly something else using her mouth. She can still tell the difference.

**d) More:** The line between her and the Voice is blurred. She channels it constantly without asking. It uses her as a mouthpiece, but she retains enough will to stop herself from killing.

**e) Next level:** She IS the Voice half the time. When it speaks through her, reality warps. She becomes a conduit for prophecy, curses, and ancient knowledge that physically hurts to hear. Only sheer force of will keeps her from destroying everything.

---

### 4. **Restraint — What stops her from killing the party?**

**a) None at all:** She's actively trying to kill them but incompetent/weakened.

**b) Subtle:** Fear of consequences (other witches would put her down), not interest (they're boring).

**c) About right:** Deep down, some fragment of who she was still cares. She fights against her own impulses, sometimes warning them to leave, sometimes helping despite herself.

**d) More:** She's made it a game or test. She COULD kill them instantly but chooses not to because she wants to see what they'll do, or she's bargained with the Voice to spare them for some cryptic reason.

**e) Next level:** The Voice itself has forbidden her from harming them. She's bound by prophecy or ancient compact—she can terrify, manipulate, and torment, but direct violence is literally impossible for her.

---

### 5. **Relationship to Elderholt — How does the coven treat her?**

**a) None at all:** She's exiled, hunted, considered a threat to be eliminated.

**b) Subtle:** Quietly forgotten. She lives at the edge of the forest, occasionally visited by Threadlings who bring food. The coven pretends she doesn't exist.

**c) About right:** She lives in one of the "retirement homes"—a warded cottage where the broken are kept. Tollbearers check on her regularly, both out of duty and to ensure she doesn't escape.

**d) More:** She's a cautionary tale told to witch-children. Sometimes brought out during rituals as a living example of what happens when you go too deep. The Elders consult her for prophecy, knowing the cost.

**e) Next level:** She's considered a sacred oracle despite (or because of) her madness. The coven builds shrines around her presence. Petitioners seek her out for forbidden knowledge, paying terrible prices for answers only she can give.

---

### 6. **Powers — What can she still do?**

**a) None at all:** Powerless. All her abilities burned away, she's just a broken shell.

**b) Subtle:** Glimpses of the future, minor curses, unsettling presence. Dangerous in subtle ways.

**c) About right:** Still formidable. Can cast powerful divination/enchantment magic, warp reality in small areas, see through time, inflict madness with a touch or word.

**d) More:** One of the most powerful witches alive. Could rival an Elder in raw ability, but unstable. Reality bends around her. Her magic is unpredictable and overwhelming.

**e) Next level:** God-like. She can rewrite fate, speak true names that unmake things, summon entities from beyond. The only reason she's not world-ending is because she's too broken to use it coherently.

---

### 7. **Danger to Party — How threatening is an encounter?**

**a) None at all:** Sad, pitiable. They might feel sorry for her.

**b) Subtle:** Unnerving but not directly dangerous. Psychological horror, disturbing revelations, uncomfortable truths.

**c) About right:** Legitimately dangerous. Could hurt/curse them if provoked, but won't initiate violence. Smart players can navigate the encounter safely.

**d) More:** Actively tests them. She'll push boundaries, inflict minor curses, speak prophecies that endanger them later. Surviving means respecting/understanding her madness.

**e) Next level:** Existential threat. Being in her presence is dangerous. She radiates corruption. Even if she doesn't attack, exposure to her could drive party members mad, curse them permanently, or alter their fates.

---

### 8. **Role in Story — What purpose does she serve?**

**a) None at all:** Random encounter, no plot relevance.

**b) Subtle:** Environmental storytelling. Shows what Elderholt's magic costs, adds atmosphere.

**c) About right:** Important NPC. Provides cryptic warnings, dangerous knowledge, or becomes a quest hook (cure her/put her down/protect her).

**d) More:** Central to Elderholt's secrets. She knows something crucial about the Voice, the Axiom, or an incoming threat. Party must risk interacting with her.

**e) Next level:** Plot lynchpin. She's tied to the world's fate. Prophecy surrounds her. Saving/destroying/understanding her changes everything. Major factions have interest in her.

## Name Generation Options

Once we settle on power level and concept, I'll generate an Elven witch name following the melodic conventions:
- `Aer/Ara` prefix (proto-root connection)
- Vowel-rich syllables (`Ith`, `Lun`, `Vel`, `Ser`)
- Soft ending (`-ael`, `-ion`, `-thil`)

Example: **Aerithael** (AIR-ith-ay-el) — "Air-touched thread"

## Next Steps

Reply with your ratings (1. c, 2. d, etc.) and any additional thoughts for each question. I'll use that to create her full character sheet.
