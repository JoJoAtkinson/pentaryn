**Tavern Brawler.** Thorgrim has advantage on grapple checks and can use his bonus action to shove a creature within 5 feet.

**Dwarven Resilience.** Advantage on saving throws against poison, and resistance to poison damage.

**Tower Shield Defense.** When Thorgrim uses his action to take the Dodge action while wielding his tower shield, he gains three-quarters cover (+5 AC).

### Traits

**Complex Loyalties.** Thorgrim left Garhammer after the war ended (⋈0, ᛏ270), seeking distance from his homeland without fully rejecting it. He supports his people in principle but finds their rigid traditions suffocating. He won't speak ill of Garhammer, but he won't return either.

**Controlled Chaos.** Thorgrim keeps the center of the common room oddly open—a deliberate choice. When patrons need to "work out their feelings," they can do so without breaking furniture. He views fist fights as just another form of conversation, provided no weapons are drawn and business continues uninterrupted.

**The Shield Rule.** Pull a weapon inside the Compass, and you'll meet Thorgrim's tower shield face-first. Otherwise, he's remarkably tolerant of scuffles. His usual resolution: free beer for both parties and "take it outside next time."

**Gruff Charm.** For a dwarf running a mixed-species tavern, Thorgrim is unusually social. He tries—genuinely tries—to be welcoming to all races. Some find his blunt, no-nonsense manner charming. Others find it off-putting. He doesn't particularly care which.

**The Ledger-Scar.** The nickname comes from a scar across his right forearm—a wound from his mercantile days in Garhammer when a ledger dispute turned violent. He wears it without shame, a reminder that even numbers can draw blood.

## Roleplay Notes

**Voice & Manner:** Deep, gravelly voice. Speaks in short, direct sentences. Rarely raises his voice—doesn't need to. When he's watching the room, he's utterly still, hands resting on the bar. When trouble brews, he moves with surprising speed.

**Common Phrases:**
- "Settle it or finish your drinks. Your choice."
- "No weapons. That's the rule. You want exceptions, find another bar."
- "Free beer says you both walk away."
- "The floor's open. Make it quick."

**What He Knows:**
- 127 years of Ardenford history, firsthand
- Trade routes and merchant networks (Garhammer legacy)
- Which adventurers are worth trusting
- The layout of the Middle Tier like the back of his hand
- More about the city's veterans than most realize

**What He Won't Talk About:**
- Why he really left Garhammer (deeper than he admits)
- Specific details about his time during the war
- His family back in the Trade League
- The small, locked chest under his bed

## Secret / Plot Hook

Thorgrim maintains stronger ties to Garhammer than he admits. A thin ledger hidden in his private quarters tracks shipments, names, and quiet payments—not smuggling, exactly, but favors owed and connections maintained. He's a node in an informal network of expatriate dwarves who left but never fully severed ties.

If the party earns his trust (or discovers the ledger), he could become a bridge into Garhammer society, trade disputes, or old grudges that followed him to Ardenford.

## Equipment

- **Tower Shield** (always within arm's reach behind the bar)
- **Studded Leather Armor** (worn under his work apron)
- **Heavy Crossbow** (loaded, mounted under the bar)
- **Dagger** (boot, backup)
- **Ledger** (hidden, encoded trade records)
- **Brass compass pendant** (never explains its significance)

## Connections

- **Torren Ashvale** (if Torren exists in your version): Fellow tavern keeper, mutual respect, occasional quiet information exchange
- **Garhammer Trade League:** Officially expatriate, unofficially still connected
- **Ardenford Veterans:** Knows many by name, keeps their business private
- **Adventurer Regulars:** Maintains a mental ledger of who's trustworthy, who owes tabs, who's likely to cause real trouble
