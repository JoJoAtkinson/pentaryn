# Vorzug Dakmar'nak (VOR-zug DAHK-mar-nak) — “Ledger-Scar”

Vorzug is a Dakmar'nak engineer who learned (the hard way) that in Garhammar, a man who cannot read the language of contracts can be made into one.

## Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Orc (Dakmar'nak tribe) |
| **Role** | Bridgewright / smith’s helper / labor advocate |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Good |
| **Location** | [Ardenford](../../../locations/ardenford.md) |
| **Affiliation** | Rakthok Horde (Dakmar'nak); Ardenhaven (resident-in-good-standing, pending) |
| **Languages** | Orcish (fluent), Common (serviceable), Dwarven (basic; learned from Bazgar) |

## Appearance

Lean and long-armed for an orc, with careful hands stained by pitch and iron-black. A pale band of scar tissue circles his wrists where Garhammar shackles once sat—his “ledger-scar”. He keeps his tusks filed short (a craftsman’s habit), and wears a simple cord necklace bearing a stamped brass tag from the labor camp he refuses to throw away.

## Personality

- **Traits:** Watchful, patient, literal-minded about promises; speaks softly until cornered.
- **Ideals:** A spoken oath is breath; a written oath is stone. If you cannot read the stone, it will bury you.
- **Bonds:** Owes a life-debt to Bazgar; still considers himself answerable to the Dakmar'nak Fire Council.
- **Flaws:** Prideful about competence; resents being treated as “muscle” and can turn coldly sarcastic.

## Background

### Captured by the Garhammar Trade League

Vorzug was taken during a trade-route sweep near a mountain pass. He couldn’t speak Dwarven, and the League’s foremen treated his silence as guilt. Without an advocate, he was “processed” into hard labor—shackled, numbered, and put to work hauling ore and turning winches until his wrists bled.

Garhammar dwarves weren’t trying to be cruel in their own telling. They were being “correct”: the papers said the labor was lawful, and without language, Vorzug couldn’t challenge the papers.

### Freed by Bazgar

When Bazgar Dakmar'nak passed through the same valley, he recognized Vorzug as a “brother” of the tribe—kin by hearth and oath, not blood. Bazgar spoke Dwarven, demanded an arbiter, and forced the foremen to produce the contract that supposedly bound Vorzug.

It didn’t exist.

Under League rules, the mistake was simple: no contract, no claim. The foremen grumbled, the arbiter signed, and Vorzug was allowed to leave.

### Why He Went to Ardenford (and Why He Stayed)

Vorzug didn’t follow Bazgar to become an adventurer. He followed because he’d learned a new kind of battlefield existed—one made of charters, petitions, and signatures—and the Dakmar'nak are raised to fight with words as well as steel.

He came to Ardenford for three honorable reasons:

1. **To make his freedom un-stealable:** Ardenhaven’s courts and Council petitions give him a record that even Garhammar respects. A filed complaint and a stamped writ make it harder for the League to “lose” him again.
2. **To turn shame into service:** He won’t go home as “the one who was taken.” He’ll go home as “the one who learned their trap.” Until then, he works openly on the Fordspine Bridgeworks, earning coin by building what war broke.
3. **To carry a message back with proof:** He intends to send the Fire Council copies of Ardenhaven’s charter language and a sworn account of Garhammar’s labor practices—tools the tribe can use to protect future envoys and captured kin.

When Bazgar moved on, Vorzug stayed. Not out of fear of the war, but because this work needed a steady hand, not a sword-arm.

## Current Role in Ardenford

- Day laborer on bridge repairs who is rapidly becoming the foreman’s “problem-solver” for ironwork that keeps failing in winter damp.
- A quiet contact for non-humans and refugees trying to navigate Ardenhaven paperwork without getting fleeced.
- A reluctant interpreter when Garhammar factors visit town; he doesn’t start fights, but he does not let “fine print” pass unchallenged.

## Using Vorzug in Play

- **Quest hook:** Vorzug asks the party to escort a sealed petition to the Council Hall after someone tampers with his paperwork.
- **Complication:** A Garhammar factor arrives with a “corrected” contract and hired muscle to reclaim “lost property.”
- **Revelation:** Vorzug kept a charcoal rubbing of a labor roster rune-mark that proves a wider pattern of illegal “processing” of non-dwarf travelers.
