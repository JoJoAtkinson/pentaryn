## The Shop: Silverbridge Arcana

A clean, well-lit storefront that smells of wax, vellum, and faint ozone. Everything has a label. Everything has a waiver.

- **Sells:** Spell scrolls (limited selection), inks, paper, quills, component pouches, focus repair, warded cases, reference pamphlets.
- **Services:** Copying mundane documents; verifying seals; identifying “obvious” magical hazards (for a fee and a signature).

### Random Finds (Spell-Counter Stock)

When the party “browses the counter,” roll on one table (or pick). Selise keeps only a few items on open display; anything more serious comes from behind the counter with a signature, a receipt, and (sometimes) a refusal.

#### Level 1 (d20) — common, curated for “prepared, not reckless”

| d20 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (1st-level):** a safe staple (detection, warding, utility). |
| 2 | **Cantrip practice sheet:** reusable vellum for somatic drills (no spell effect). |
| 3 | **Component pouch refill:** labeled pinch-tins for the “boring bits” casters forget. |
| 4 | **Warded scroll sleeve:** resists damp, soot, and casual rummaging. |
| 5 | **Ink: “Deep Black” (1 bottle):** dries fast; excellent for crisp runes. |
| 6 | **Ink: “Signal Blue” (1 bottle):** faintly luminescent (not magical), great in caves. |
| 7 | **Quill set (3):** stiff, medium, and “fine-line” for tight sigils. |
| 8 | **Seal-wax kit:** simple stamps + wax with a pamphlet titled “Forgery Is a Crime.” |
| 9 | **Counterfeit-test swab (1):** reagent wipe to spot common fake-scroll inks. |
| 10 | **Hazard tag bundle (10):** “CURSED,” “FRAGILE,” “DO NOT READ ALOUD,” etc. |
| 11 | **Arcane focus repair voucher:** one re-wrap/re-set (with a lecture included). |
| 12 | **Reference pamphlet:** “Common Ruin Sigils and What They Usually Mean.” |
| 13 | **Diagram card:** quick notes for *alarm* placement and camp perimeter logic. |
| 14 | **Diagram card:** “How to Not Miscast *identify*” (mostly about patience). |
| 15 | **Scroll-case of dryglass:** keeps paper safe even if dropped in the river. |
| 16 | **Chalk of clean lines (12 sticks):** for circles, labels, and “don’t step here.” |
| 17 | **Lantern-lens (clip-on):** makes faint ink strokes pop under lamplight. |
| 18 | **“No-bleed” blotter papers (5):** prevents smears and accidental rune-bridges. |
| 19 | **Customer return:** a slightly singed scroll sleeve at a discount, with a story. |
| 20 | **Shelf oddity:** a “lesson scroll” that explains a spell but does not cast it. |

#### Level 2 (d12) — uncommon, behind the counter

| d12 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (2nd-level):** mobility or defense, sold with strict handling notes. |
| 2 | **Warded document case:** resists damp and discourages casual tampering. |
| 3 | **Ink: “Oath Red” (1 bottle):** used for legal seals; hard to counterfeit cleanly. |
| 4 | **Spellbook binding service:** stitching and hinge repair; takes a day or two. |
| 5 | **Focus brace:** a fitted wrap that stops a cracked focus from getting worse. |
| 6 | **Sleeve of silence:** a scroll sleeve that muffles rustle and avoids telltale crackle. |
| 7 | **Lock-tag kit:** wax seals + numbered tags for “who opened this?” accountability. |
| 8 | **Lens of closework:** a little magnifier for fine runes and hairline fractures. |
| 9 | **Ink solvent:** removes old runes from stone/wood (slow, messy, effective). |
| 10 | **Scriptorium slate:** reusable writing board; holds chalk-runes in neat grids. |
| 11 | **Library referral chit:** legitimate paperwork that opens a door (briefly). |
| 12 | **“Waiver bundle”:** pre-written forms for hazardous purchases (Selise is pleased). |

#### Level 3 (d8) — rare-ish, usually by request

| d8 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (3rd-level):** serious magic; Selise asks *why* you need it. |
| 2 | **Counterspell primer folio:** theory notes and duel etiquette (no spell effect). |
| 3 | **Glyph-lacquer (1 use):** stabilizes a complex rune long enough to finish the job. |
| 4 | **Ward-stitch thread:** for sewing a temporary sigil into cloth/leather (1 scene). |
| 5 | **Ruin-sample jars (3):** warded glass for dust, ash, fungus, or “don’t touch.” |
| 6 | **“Observer’s” candle:** reveals soot-smears and fresh handprints under its light. |
| 7 | **Scribe’s midnight ink (1 dose):** writing fades after a day unless sealed. |
| 8 | **Tamper bell-charm:** rings softly if a case/sleeve is opened without the key. |

#### Level 4 (d6) — very rare in the shop

| d6 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (4th-level):** not displayed; sale recorded with witnesses. |
| 2 | **Dryglass strongbox:** heavy, warded, and expensive; built for one item. |
| 3 | **Scry-splinter bead:** cracks if someone tries to watch you magically (once). |
| 4 | **Ink of binding (one dose):** makes contracts harder to “misread” later. |
| 5 | **Runic stencil plates:** precise templates for repeating a symbol consistently. |
| 6 | **Library-only sleeve:** sealed with charter wax; “do not open without authorization.” |

#### Level 5 (d4) — almost never on the shelf

| d4 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (5th-level):** requires a private conversation and paperwork. |
| 2 | **Charter sealed writ:** access to restricted stacks, time-limited and monitored. |
| 3 | **True-name ink (one dose):** writing burns slightly; attracts attention if misused. |
| 4 | **“Not for retail” case:** sealed and addressed to someone else (and Selise knows it). |

## Personality

- **Traits:** Calm, precise, unfailingly courteous.
- **Ideals:** Magic is a civic responsibility, not a private thrill.
- **Bonds:** Maintains a standing agreement with the Concordance Library for controlled access to reference texts.
- **Flaws:** Keeps customers at arm’s length; will refuse service if she thinks you’re reckless—even if you can pay.

## Using Selise in Play

- **Quest hook:** A batch of counterfeit scrolls is circulating in the Lower Tier. Selise wants them stopped quietly before the Council turns it into a crackdown.
- **What she knows:** Which adventuring parties file reports with the library, who buys anti-undead supplies, and which “harmless trinkets” keep showing up from the same ruin site.
