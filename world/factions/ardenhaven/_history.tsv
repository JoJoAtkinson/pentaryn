arden-001	 calderon-imperium;conflict;diplomacy;ardenhaven                   	 4110      	        0	 The Border Provocations Begin	 Calderon Imperium begins systematic political and territorial pressure on Ardenhaven city-states. What starts as diplomatic disputes over border towns quickly escalates to armed skirmishes. The Ardenhaven city-states respond individually, uncoordinated and vulnerable.

The talks collapse due to historical rivalries, trade disputes, and distrust. Each city-state returns home believing they can negotiate separately with Calderon.

The affected city-states appeal to their neighbors for military aid. None respond. This moment becomes a rallying cry in later years: "When they came for the border towns, we stood alone."

Hundreds of farming families are killed or displaced. The atrocity galvanizes public opinion—Calderon is no longer seen as a negotiating partner but as an existential threat.
arden-005	 ardenhaven;government;diplomacy                                   	 4172/11   	       90	 The Unification Debates      	 Facing mounting Calderon pressure, Ardenhaven city-states convene emergency talks lasting three months. Bitter debates over sovereignty, military command, taxation, and governance nearly collapse into violence. Ultimately, survival outweighs pride: they agree to act as one federation, preserving local governance but pooling military and diplomatic authority.

Each city-state retains internal governance but surrenders war-making power to a unified Council of Consuls. Merrowgate, invited to join, formally declines and declares perpetual neutrality.
ardenc007	 calderon-imperium;battle;conflict;ardenhaven;public               	 4193/04   	        0	 Calderon's Declaration       	 Calderon Imperium issues formal declaration of conquest: all Ardenhaven lands are claimed as imperial territory, and continued resistance will be met with total war. The language is unambiguous—there will be no negotiated peace, only submission or annihilation. The 7-year war begins.
arden-008	 ardenhaven;battle;conflict                                        	 4194/08   	      365	 The Year of Conscription     	 Ardenhaven enacts unprecedented mass mobilization. Every able-bodied person—men, women, youth old enough to hold weapons—is called to service. Those with nursing children are exempted; everyone else fights. Entire towns empty. Fields go unplowed. The choice is simple: fight now or lose everything.

No heroes, no decisive victories—just endless waves of soldiers meeting in fields of mud and blood. Casualties on both sides are catastrophic. The plains are later named for the funeral pyres that burned for weeks.

Both sides suffer mass starvation. The siege breaks not through valor but through mutual exhaustion—neither army has the strength to continue. The granaries are left ruined and empty, a monument to futility.

Both sides bury their dead—tens of thousands on each side. Mass graves are dug across the contested territories. Survivors on both sides recognize the war cannot be won by either nation. Whispers of peace begin, though neither government admits defeat.

The negotiations are tense, bitter, and slow. Four months of debate over borders, reparations, and recognition. Both sides cling to pride while accepting reality: continuation means mutual destruction.
ardenc-013	 ardenhaven;calderon-imperium;merrowgate;diplomacy;law;world;public	 4200/07/12	        0	 The Pentarch Accords         	 Ardenhaven, Calderon Imperium, and seven other factions sign the Pentarch Accords in Merrowgate. The treaty formally ends the Imperial Wars and establishes the Age of Trade. Borders are recognized, reparations waived, and all signatories pledge to resolve disputes through commerce rather than conquest. The world exhales.
ardenc-014	 ardenhaven;calderon-imperium;economy;trade;public                 	 4215      	        0	 The First Trade Caravans     	 Fifteen years after the Pentarch Accords, the first official Ardenhaven-Calderon trade caravan crosses the former battlefields. Ardenhaven grain for Calderon coal and iron. The exchange is awkward, stilted, watched by veterans on both sides. But it happens. Commerce begins to replace contempt.

The former battlefields are farmland again. A new generation knows the war only through their grandparents' stories and the mass graves that still mark the plains.

The Council of Consuls debates exporting surplus grain to former enemies and neighbors. One city-state—scarred by siege memories—votes against, arguing for strategic reserves. The majority prevails: Ardenhaven becomes the continent's breadbasket, choosing prosperity through generosity over isolation. The dissenting city-state accepts the vote but builds its own emergency granaries anyway.
ardenc-017	 ardenhaven;government;conflict;lore;public                        	 4299      	     9855	 The Monument Dispute         	 Three generations after the war, Ardenhaven's city-states cannot agree on how to commemorate the Winter of Graves. Some demand heroic monuments celebrating resilience. Others insist on somber memorials acknowledging mutual suffering with Calderon. One radical faction proposes bulldozing the mass graves and planting wheat—"let the dead feed the living." The Council of Consuls deadlocks repeatedly. Each city-state builds its own memorial in its own style. The dispute remains unresolved 28 years later in 4327, a scar that won't heal—but also proof the federation can survive profound disagreement.

Not out of fear—the Pentarch Accords hold—but as Cold War-style deterrent: "We are ready." The towers are staffed, supplied, and connected by signal fires. Calderon takes notice. The project demonstrates Ardenhaven's maturity as a federation: unified military infrastructure built and maintained across formerly fractious city-states. Two years of construction, a statement of vigilant peace.
ardenc-019	 ardenhaven;government;law;lore;public                            	 4323      	     1460	 The Ruins Reclamation Act    	 Facing vast territorial expansion and countless ancient ruins across former battlefields, the Council of Consuls declares a controversial policy: any treasure or artifacts found in ruins belong to the finder, no questions asked. The government is transparent about their motives—they lack the researchers and resources to explore these sites themselves, and the ruins attract monsters that endanger civilian settlements. By offering legal ownership of findings, Ardenhaven attracts adventurers, treasure hunters, and sellswords who simultaneously clear threats while seeking fortune. Critics call it reckless. Pragmatists call it efficient. Four years later in 4327, the policy has drawn hundreds of adventurers to Ardenhaven's borderlands.
