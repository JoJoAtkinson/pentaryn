# Goblin Raid

**CR:** 1  
**Location:** Western farmlands, ~2 miles from Ardenford  
**Reward:** 70gp (party split)  
**Posted by:** Maren Redwick, sheep farmer

---

## Quest Giver: Maren Redwick

**Appearance:** Early 40s, weathered face, calloused hands, speaks quickly when nervous  
**Occupation:** Sheep farmer, third generation on same land  
**Demeanor:** Desperate but trying to stay composed; proud but knows she needs help  
**Hook:** "They took twelve ewes last night. I can't afford to lose any more."

---

## The Problem

Goblins (4-6) have been raiding Maren's flock for three nights running. They strike at dusk, scatter the flock, and drag off 2-3 sheep each time. They're getting bolder—last night they threw rocks at Maren when she tried to chase them off with her lantern.

**Tracks lead southwest** into rocky scrubland where old ruin foundations jut from the hillside.

---

## The Encounter

**Enemies:** 5 goblins (use standard goblin stats)  
**Terrain:** Rocky scrubland with scattered boulders, low visibility at dusk  
**Tactics:** Goblins use hit-and-run; hide behind rocks, throw javelins, retreat if bloodied

**Lair:** Small cave entrance hidden by collapsed stones—inside are gnawed bones (sheep and small animals), crude bedrolls, stolen goods (farming tools, lanterns, a child's toy).

**Treasure:** 23sp scattered in cave, 1 gold ring (8gp value—stolen from another farm), farming tools Maren will recognize.

---

## Complications (Optional)

- One goblin tries to surrender if cornered (speaks broken Common, claims "Boss said easy food here")
- Sheep are penned in the back of the cave—party can return them for bonus gratitude
- Tracks suggest more goblins nearby (future quest hook)

---

## Resolution

**Success:** Maren pays the full 70gp, offers free room in her barn anytime, spreads word that the party is reliable  
**Bonus:** Return sheep alive → she throws in 2 wheels of sharp cheese and invites them to next harvest festival
