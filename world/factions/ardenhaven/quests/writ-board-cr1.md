# The Wayward Compass — Writ Board

> **Posted notices for adventurers seeking work in and around Ardenford**

---

## Notice #1: SHEEP RAIDS — URGENT HELP NEEDED

```
To any capable hands:

Goblins have been raiding my flock three nights running. 
Twelve ewes gone. I can't lose any more.

They come at dusk from the west scrublands near the old ruins.
I'll pay 70 gold pieces to see them stopped.

Find me at Redwick Farm, two miles west on the old cart road.

— Maren Redwick
```

**How it's posted:** Hastily written on cheap parchment, smudged ink in places. Pinned with an old iron nail. The handwriting shakes slightly in places—stress, not lack of education.

## Notice #2: LUMBER CAMP CLEARANCE — SPIDERS

```
WORK AVAILABLE

Giant spiders. Old lumber camp. Three miles south, 
forest road past Miller's Creek.

Need camp cleared. Tools retrieved. No questions.

80 gold. Payment on completion.

Ask for Gareth Thorne at Western Market, 
leather-stall, mornings only.
```

**How it's posted:** Printed on better quality paper (professionally done, probably paid a scribe). Neatly tacked to the board with a proper pin. No flourishes, no emotion—pure business transaction.

## Notice #3: BORDER PATROL — UNDEAD SIGHTING

```
Attention: Capable Adventurers

Undead spotted in eastern valley near old battlefield.
Four to five walking toward the city.

They must be stopped and properly laid to rest.

Offering 75 gold pieces for this service.

Inquire with Renn Caldor, border patrol.
Ask at the bar—Torren knows where to find me.

— R. Caldor, Ardenhaven Border Scouts
```

**How it's posted:** Written in careful, measured script—someone used to military reports. Posted on aged parchment with an official Ardenhaven border patrol wax seal (small, discreet) in the bottom corner. Pinned neatly with a brass tack.
