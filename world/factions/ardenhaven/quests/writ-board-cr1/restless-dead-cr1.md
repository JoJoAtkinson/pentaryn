# Restless Dead

**CR:** 1  
**Location:** Eastern mountain valley, old battlefield ~4 miles from Ardenford  
**Reward:** 75gp (party split)  
**Posted by:**Renn Caldor, border patrol Scout

---

## Quest Giver: Renn Caldor

**Appearance:** Early 30s, clean-shaven, wears his grandfather's war medal on a chain around his neck  
**Occupation:** Border patrol scout  
**Demeanor:** Grief-stricken but determined; this is deeply personal, not just duty  
**Hook:** "My grandmother died three weeks ago. Her last words were 'Bury me with Corwin.' My grandfather never came home from the war. I think he's out there, walking."

---

## The Problem

Undead (4-5 skeletons) have been spotted shambling through the eastern valley, moving steadily toward Ardenford. Renn's grandfather, Corwin Caldor, fell in a skirmish in that valley 127 years ago. His body was never recovered—the battlefield was abandoned when enemy forces raised the dead. 

**Why Renn believes his grandfather is among them:** A traveler reported seeing one of the skeletons wearing a **distinctive bronze pauldron with an oak tree emblem**—the mark of Corwin's unit, the Ridgeward Battalion. Renn's grandmother described it her whole life, kept the matching medal Corwin sent home before he died.

They're not overtly hostile—just walking—but they can't be allowed near the city.

**Atmosphere:** Valley is windswept and cold. Ancient battlefield markers (weathered stones). The skeletons move with eerie purpose, not hunger.

## The Encounter

**Enemies:** 4 skeletons (use standard skeleton stats)  
**Terrain:** Rocky valley with scattered burial cairns, elevation changes, loose stones  
**Tactics:** Skeletons don't attack unless threatened; they attempt to walk past the party toward Ardenford. If engaged, they fight defensively but without strategy.

**Moral Choice:** Party can attack immediately OR attempt to communicate/understand. Skeletons respond to gentle voices (DC 13 Persuasion or Religion check reveals they're confused, seeking "home").

**Proper Burial:** If party destroys skeletons and buries remains with respect (DC 10 Religion check for proper rites), Renn is deeply moved.

**Identifying Grandfather:** One skeleton wears a **corroded bronze pauldron with faint oak tree emblem**. Renn recognizes it immediately—this is Corwin. Among the bones: Ardenhaven military insignia, rotted personal effects, 18sp, and one intact silver ring engraved "Maris" (his grandmother's name—Renn breaks down when he sees it).

---

## Complications (Optional)

- One skeleton wears Calderon uniform (enemy side)—Renn stiffens but says "War's over. My grandmother would want them all buried properly."
- If party shows exceptional respect (proper burial, prayers), Renn shares family stories about Corwin and invites them to the burial ceremony
- Renn asks if he can keep the ring and pauldron—"To bury with Grandmother, like she wanted"
- More undead in valley (future quest hook)—old battlefield hasn't been fully cleared

---

## Resolution

**Success:** Renn pays 75gp, voice thick with emotion  
**Bonus:** Proper burial + party helps him identify grandfather → Renn adds 15gp from personal funds, says "She can rest now. Thank you." Invites party to attend joint burial ceremony (roleplay opportunity, connection to veteran community)  
**Consequence:** Party desecrates remains or is disrespectful → Renn pays but refuses future work with them, word spreads that party dishonored the dead

**Description:** Animated human skeletons in rotted military uniforms. Bones yellowed with age, armor corroded. One wears a bronze pauldron with oak tree emblem (Corwin).
