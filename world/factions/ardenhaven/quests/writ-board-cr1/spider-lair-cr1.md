# Spider Lair

**CR:** 1  
**Location:** Southern forest, abandoned lumber camp ~3 miles from Ardenford  
**Reward:** 80gp (party split)  
**Posted by:** Gareth Thorne, forester

---

## Quest Giver: Gareth Thorne

**Appearance:** Late 30s, scarred forearms, rarely makes eye contact, smells of pine sap  
**Occupation:** Forester and lumber contractor  
**Demeanor:** Blunt, pragmatic, no time for pleasantries; treats this as business transaction  
**Hook:** "Lost two workers already. Need the camp cleared. That's it."

---

## The Problem

Giant spiders (3-4) have nested in an old lumber camp Gareth's crew abandoned three weeks ago. Two workers disappeared investigating; Gareth found webbing and drag marks but no bodies. He needs the camp cleared to retrieve valuable tools and resume operations.

**Atmosphere:** The forest is unnaturally quiet near the camp. Thick webbing between trees. The smell of decay.

---

## The Encounter

**Enemies:** 3 giant spiders (use standard giant spider stats)  
**Terrain:** Overgrown lumber camp with 2 collapsed shacks, webbing between trees creates difficult terrain  
**Tactics:** Spiders attack from above; Web attack to restrain, then bite; defend nest aggressively

**Nest:** Inside the largest shack—thick webbing, egg sacs (not yet hatched), and two cocoons containing:
- Worker 1: Dead (wrapped 2 weeks ago, desiccated)
- Worker 2: Barely alive (unconscious, poisoned, needs immediate aid—DC 12 Medicine check or healing magic)

**Treasure:** In shack corner: 45sp, quality woodworking tools (worth 20gp to Gareth), a silver locket (12gp value, belonged to Worker 1).

---

## Complications (Optional)

- Egg sacs—party must decide whether to destroy them (morally gray choice)
- Worker 2 survives if saved quickly; dies if party takes too long exploring
- Webbing is flammable (can solve encounter creatively but risks burning camp/forest)

---

## Resolution

**Success:** Gareth pays 80gp, acknowledges party competence with grudging nod  
**Bonus:** Save Worker 2 alive → Gareth pays extra 20gp and owes them a favor (future lumber/supplies at cost)  
**Consequence:** Worker 2 dies → Gareth still pays but word spreads that party was "too slow"
