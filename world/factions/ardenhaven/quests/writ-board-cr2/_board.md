# The Wayward Compass — Writ Board (CR2)

> **Posted notices for adventurers seeking work in Ardenford**

## Distilled Alcohol Delivery
[Willowglass Apothecary](../../locations/ardenford/shops/willowglass-apothecary.md) needs help acquiring a supply of distilled alcohol for potions—its usual supplier is missing, and the shop suspects black market interference.

## Debt Collection
[The Anvil & Oar](../../locations/ardenford/shops/the-anvil-and-oar.md): the smith’s sister owes money to a dangerous lender. He wants help settling the debt quietly before thugs come calling.

## Book Return — Concordance Library
The Concordance Library reports a rare volume stolen by a local wizard. Job is to recover the book **undamaged** and bring the wizard back **alive** (not slain, not vanished) so the librarians can put him to a formal questioning—this wasn’t just theft, it was a breach of civic trust and they need names, motives, and assurance no wards or copied pages remain.
