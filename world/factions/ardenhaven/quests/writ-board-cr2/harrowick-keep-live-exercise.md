## Posted Notice (verbatim)

```
HARROWICK KEEP — CONTRACT NOTICE
Issued by the Harrowick Keep Training Office
Under authority of the Rapid Response Companies

We require capable contractors to conduct an unannounced live exercise for trainee squads.

Objective: Ambush and capture a designated group of trainees during a scheduled field run.
Trainees will be unarmed and will NOT be told an exercise is underway.
The intent is to harden judgment under uncertainty and teach response to the unknown.

Why external contractors: Internal patrols are predictable to our recruits. Unknown hands and
unfamiliar tactics test readiness honestly without favoritism, grudges, or rehearsed routes.

Rules of engagement (binding):
- Nonlethal force only. On surrender, the encounter ends.
- No harm beyond what a duty cleric can undo with routine field healing (Cure Wounds and Lesser Restoration).
  Any lasting injury is a contract breach.
- No poisons. No fire. No necromancy. No curses. No magic that alters memory or compels obedience.
- Restrain with rope, net, manacles, grapples, or sleep/immobilizing effects.
- Do not interfere with civilians or property. Do not take trophies or personal effects.

Identification and control:
- Contractors will be issued an exercise token at briefing; present it if challenged by keep personnel.
- Use the call word "HOLD FAST" to halt the exercise immediately.

Pay: 160 gold upon completion and debrief.

Report: Harrowick Keep, east-facing service door, first light.
Ask for Clerk Rella Dunsford (Training Office) and present this notice.

## DM Notes

- This is OPFOR-style readiness training: the trainees don’t know it’s a drill, so their reactions are real.
- Outsiders are hired to avoid predictability (recruits learn faces/voices/patterns) and to prevent internal favoritism or grudges.
- Harrowick keeps a duty cleric on standby; “no lasting harm” is enforced with immediate triage and hard consequences for contractors who overstep.
- If the party plays it smart, reward the *capture* and the *lesson learned* (good restraint, clean disengages, minimal public disruption).
