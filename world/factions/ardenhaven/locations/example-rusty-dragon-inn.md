## Description

> As you approach the two-story building, you notice the weathered wooden sign depicting a red dragon perched atop a pile of rusted armor and weapons. The scent of freshly baked bread and roasting meat wafts from within, and warm light glows through the windows. The sound of laughter and conversation filters out into the street.

The Rusty Dragon is Sandpoint's most popular inn, known for its comfortable beds, hearty meals, and welcoming atmosphere. The building is well-maintained timber construction with a stone foundation. The ground floor houses the common room and kitchen, while the second floor contains guest rooms. A small stable out back can accommodate up to six horses.

## History

The building was originally a warehouse that fell into disrepair. Twenty years ago, Gareth Ironwood purchased it and spent a year renovating it into an inn. The name comes from Gareth's encounter with a rust-colored dragon during his adventuring days. Over the years, it has become the premier lodging establishment in Sandpoint.

## DM Notes

This is the default "home base" for the party during their time in Sandpoint. Gareth can serve as a quest giver, information source, and friendly NPC. His backstory allows him to provide adventuring advice without being a "powerful retired adventurer" who overshadows the party.

Use this location for:
- Rest and recovery between adventures
- Meeting other NPCs and quest givers
- Gathering rumors and information
- Shopping and resupply (Gareth can direct them to shops)
