# Thorndale

> Sheep, cattle, and the smell of wool drying: a herding village built on leather and livestock.

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Region** | [Ardenhaven](../../_overview.md) |
| **Type** | Livestock Village |
| **Population** | ~120 |
| **Distance from Ardenford** | 8 miles southeast |
| **Primary Industry** | Sheep herding, cattle raising |
| **Notable Features** | Tannery, wool-drying sheds, livestock pens |

## Description

Thorndale sprawls across rolling pastures southeast of [Ardenford](ardenford/ardenford.md), where sheep and cattle graze on grasslands bordered by thorny hedgerows. The village is built around livestock: pens, barns, wool-drying sheds, and a tannery that processes hides into leather.

The air smells of wool, manure, and tanning chemicals—a working smell that marks the village from a mile away. Herders drive their flocks to market in Ardenford weekly, and shearers arrive seasonally to work the spring wool harvest.

## Economy

- **Primary Export:** Wool, leather, and livestock (sheep, cattle)
- **Secondary:** Tallow candles, preserved meat
- **Trade:** Supplies Ardenford with leather goods and meat; buys grain from [Calstead](calstead.md)

## Notable Locations

- **The Tannery:** Operated by the Redmar family; processes hides into quality leather
- **Shearing Yards:** Open-air workspace for spring wool harvest; hired shearers work here
- **Livestock Market:** Monthly auction where herders sell animals to Ardenford merchants

## Key NPCs

- **Shepherd Glenmar** (Human, mid 40s) - Village elder; manages grazing rights and herd counts
- **Tanner Redmar** (Human, late 30s) - Runs the tannery; skilled leatherworker with clients in Ardenford
- **Herder Oakton** (Human, early 20s) - Young ambitious herder; talks about "opportunity in the ruins"

## Hooks & Rumors

- Wolves have been taking sheep from the eastern pastures; some say they're too bold, too organized
- A calf was born with two heads last week; Glenmar quietly had it put down and burned
- Oakton wants to hire adventurers to "scout routes" toward the western scrublands
