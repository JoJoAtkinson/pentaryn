# Valley Ruins: Underground Chambers

Modular rooms for the underground ruins near Ardenford. Each can be used independently or connected as part of a larger complex.

---

## Chamber 1: The Ritual Pool

### Description
A circular chamber, 40 feet across, with a shallow pool carved into the center of the floor. The water is unnaturally still and reflects no light—looking into it is like staring into a starless night sky. Ancient glyphs line the walls, faintly glowing with pale blue light. Four stone pillars surround the pool, each carved with different phases of the moon.

The air tastes metallic. Your footsteps echo wrong, as if the chamber is larger than it appears.

### Features
- **The Pool**: 10 feet diameter, 2 feet deep. The water is safe but unsettling. Submerging an object for 1 minute reveals visions of its history (DM's discretion).
- **Glyphs**: A DC 15 Arcana check reveals they're protective wards, though heavily degraded. They once prevented extraplanar intrusion.
- **Pillars**: Carved stone, solid. One pillar shows signs of being repaired with different stone.

### Hazard
If anyone speaks loudly or casts a spell above 2nd level, roll 1d6. On a 1-2, the pool ripples violently and releases a **Shadow** (MM p. 269) that was trapped within.

### Loot
- **Hidden in the repaired pillar** (DC 14 Investigation): A sealed stone box containing:
  - *Potion of Water Breathing*
  - *Scroll of Detect Magic*
  - A silver coin etched with unfamiliar constellations (50 gp to a collector)
- **In the pool** (requires reaching in): A dagger with a moonstone pommel (*+1 Dagger*, glows faintly in moonlight)

## Chamber 2: The Collapsed Library

### Description
What remains of a once-grand library. Stone shelves line the walls but most have crumbled, scattering broken tablets and rotted scrolls across the floor. The ceiling has partially collapsed in the southeast corner, creating a pile of rubble and exposing the earth above. Mold grows in dark corners, and the air is thick with dust and decay.

Amid the destruction, one shelf remains intact—stone carved with protective runes, holding several items that survived the centuries.

### Features
- **Rubble Pile**: Can be climbed with a DC 12 Athletics check. Unstable—failure causes 1d6 bludgeoning damage as debris shifts.
- **Intact Shelf**: Protected by preservation magic. The runes are faded but still functional.
- **Broken Tablets**: Most are illegible, but 1d4 hours of work yields fragments about the ancient civilization's calendar system.

### Hazard
**Toxic Mold** in the northeast corner. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. Fire destroys the mold.

### Loot
- **On the intact shelf**:
  - A leather journal, miraculously preserved, containing notes on local geography (grants advantage on Survival checks in the region for 1 week after studying for 1 hour)
  - *Spell scroll: Comprehend Languages*
  - *Spell scroll: Identify*
  - A bronze astrolabe (75 gp, helps with navigation)
- **Hidden beneath rubble** (DC 16 Investigation, 10 minutes to excavate):
  - A stone tablet with a complete map of this ruin level
  - 3 gemstones: 2x jade (10 gp each), 1x amber (50 gp)

## Chamber 3: The Armory Vault

### Description
A long, rectangular room with weapon racks along both walls. Most weapons have corroded into rust and dust, but a few pieces remain intact—protected by the dry air and residual magic. At the far end, a large stone chest sits beneath a faded banner showing an unknown heraldic symbol: a circle bisected by a vertical line with two horizontal lines crossing it.

The floor is etched with a complex geometric pattern that seems to shift when you're not looking directly at it.

### Features
- **Weapon Racks**: Mostly empty or holding rusted junk. Three intact weapons remain (see loot).
- **Stone Chest**: Locked (DC 18 Thieves' Tools) or can be forced open (DC 20 Athletics). Weighs 300 lbs, immobile.
- **Floor Pattern**: A DC 16 Arcana check reveals it's a partial warding circle, no longer functional but once prevented teleportation.

### Trap
The stone chest is trapped. Opening it without disarming the trap (DC 16 Investigation to notice, DC 16 Thieves' Tools to disarm) triggers a **Glyph of Warding** (3rd level, *Lightning Bolt* stored, DC 14 Dex save, 8d6 lightning damage, half on success).

### Loot
- **On the weapon racks**:
  - *+1 Spear* (tarnished but functional, ancient design)
  - *Silvered shortsword* (ornate hilt, well-balanced)
  - A shield with the same heraldic symbol, still sturdy but non-magical
- **Inside the chest** (after dealing with trap):
  - *+1 Chain shirt* (sized for Medium humanoid)
  - *Potion of Greater Healing*
  - 80 gp in ancient coins
  - A sealed letter written in Ancient (requires *Comprehend Languages* or translation—contains orders to "hold the lower passages at all costs")

## Chamber 4: The Meditation Sanctum

### Description
A peaceful, octagonal room with a domed ceiling. Eight alcoves are carved into the walls, each containing a stone bench. In the center of the room, a small fountain still trickles with fresh water—somehow still flowing after all these centuries. The acoustics here are perfect; even whispers carry clearly to every alcove.

The walls are carved with serene nature scenes: forests, mountains, rivers, and fields of grain. No figures appear in any scene.

### Features
- **Fountain**: The water is pure and safe. Drinking grants the benefit of a short rest in only 30 minutes (once per creature).
- **Alcoves**: Sitting in meditation for 10 minutes grants advantage on the next Wisdom saving throw within the next hour.
- **Acoustics**: Conversations can be heard clearly from anywhere in the room, making surprise impossible here.

### Secret
One alcove (DC 15 Investigation) has a hidden compartment beneath the bench. It contains personal effects from an ancient monk.

### Loot
- **Hidden compartment**:
  - *Pearl of Power*
  - A string of prayer beads (non-magical but beautifully crafted, 25 gp)
  - A small personal journal (in Ancient) describing meditation techniques that grant insight into the Axiom's nature (provides lore about ancient magic)
  - *Potion of Healing*

## Chamber 5: The Sealed Treasury

### Description
A reinforced vault chamber with walls of solid stone blocks fitted so precisely no mortar was needed. The door is a massive slab of stone, 6 inches thick, currently propped open by debris—it can't be closed without clearing the rubble. Chisel marks on the doorframe suggest someone tried to force their way in long ago but gave up.

Inside, stone shelves hold a variety of objects. Some shelves have collapsed, others remain intact. There's no dust here—the air is completely still, as if time stopped.

### Features
- **Stone Door**: Would require immense strength (DC 25 Athletics) to move if the rubble were cleared. It's designed to seal from the inside.
- **Preservation Field**: Subtle magic keeps everything inside from decaying. This is why the air is still.
- **Shelves**: Mix of collapsed and intact. The intact ones hold the most valuable items.

### Guardian
A **Glyphspider** (from underground-ruins-monsters.md) lies dormant in the northeast corner. It activates if anyone takes more than one item without speaking the proper passphrase in Ancient (which no one knows).

### Loot
- **On intact shelves**:
  - *Bag of Holding*
  - 3x *Potions of Healing*
  - 150 gp in ancient coins and small gemstones
  - A silver circlet set with a moonstone (*Circlet of Blasting*)
  - A crystal vial containing silvery liquid (*Potion of Gaseous Form*)
- **On collapsed shelves** (requires clearing, 5 minutes):
  - *Wand of Magic Detection*
  - Decorative items worth 75 gp total
  - A small locked box (DC 14 Thieves' Tools) containing 5 small diamonds (50 gp each)

## Chamber 6: The Scribe's Workshop

### Description
A cramped, L-shaped room littered with broken pottery, dried ink stains, and scattered parchment fragments. A stone desk occupies one corner, its surface covered in fossilized ink splotches and tool marks. Empty pigeonholes line one wall where scrolls once were stored. Everything speaks of hasty abandonment.

In the far corner, a stone basin still contains dried pigment—red, black, and gold.

### Features
- **Desk**: Solid stone, carved with small drawers. One drawer is stuck (DC 12 Strength to force open).
- **Pigeonholes**: Empty except for one that contains a rolled parchment (see loot).
- **Basin**: The dried pigments are still usable if reconstituted with water. Worth 10 gp to a calligrapher.

### Clue
The parchment in the pigeonholes is a partial map showing a deeper level of the ruins with a chamber marked "Do not unseal."

### Loot
- **In the stuck drawer**:
  - *Quill of Scribing* (uncommon magical item: never runs out of ink, writes in any language the user knows)
  - *Spell scroll: Illusory Script*
  - 3 sheets of preserved parchment (5 gp each to a scribe)
- **In the pigeonholes**:
  - Partial map (as described above)
  - A personal letter (in Ancient) expressing fear about "the sealed chamber" and "what we found below"
- **Hidden beneath loose floor stone** (DC 18 Investigation):
  - A gold signet ring with the same heraldic symbol from the armory (75 gp, or significant if reunited with someone who knows the symbol)

## Chamber 7: The Alchemist's Laboratory

### Description
A dangerous room. Shattered glass covers the floor, and the smell of sulfur and ozone lingers in the stale air. Stone tables hold corroded equipment, cracked beakers, and unidentifiable stains. One table appears to have exploded at some point, leaving a blast pattern on the wall behind it.

Two sets of stone shelves remain standing, holding sealed containers of various sizes. Some glow faintly.

### Features
- **Glass Debris**: Difficult terrain. Moving carelessly requires a DC 12 Dexterity save or take 1d4 piercing damage.
- **Blast Pattern**: A DC 14 Arcana or Investigation check reveals it was caused by a magical explosion, likely a failed experiment.
- **Shelves**: Most containers are empty or contain inert residue. Five containers remain sealed.

### Hazard
**Unstable Reagents**: If the room is subjected to fire damage or loud noise (thunder damage, explosive spells), roll 1d6. On a 1-3, one of the sealed containers shatters, releasing toxic gas. All creatures in the room must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

### Loot
- **Sealed containers on shelves**:
  - 2x *Potions of Healing*
  - 1x *Potion of Resistance (Fire)*
  - 1x *Alchemist's Fire*
  - 1x Unknown alchemical mixture (DM's choice: could be beneficial, explosive, or useless)
- **In a locked cabinet** (DC 15 Thieves' Tools, reinforced to survive the explosion):
  - *Alchemy Jug*
  - A leather notebook containing alchemical formulas (worth 50 gp to an alchemist, grants advantage on next 3 alchemical crafting checks)
  - 3 vials of rare alchemical components (15 gp each)
  - A brass key labeled (in Ancient) "Lower Gate"

## Chamber 8: The Offering Chamber

### Description
A solemn chamber with a raised stone altar at its center. The altar is carved from a single piece of black stone, its surface worn smooth by countless offerings. Around the altar, the floor is inlaid with silver forming a complex mandala pattern. Three stone braziers stand around the altar, cold but containing ancient ash.

The walls depict scenes of supplication and protection—people offering treasures to unseen forces, waves of darkness being held at bay.

### Features
- **Altar**: Radiates faint abjuration magic (DC 12 Arcana to detect). Placing an offering of value (minimum 25 gp) grants a *Bless* effect for 1 hour.
- **Mandala**: If traced correctly (DC 14 Religion or Arcana check, 10 minutes), grants insight into protective magic (+2 bonus to next saving throw against spells).
- **Braziers**: If lit with fire and incense (incense worth 10 gp), they ward against undead for 8 hours (undead have disadvantage on attacks within this chamber).

### Guardian Spirit
If the party disturbs the altar without making an offering, a **Ruin Wraith** (from underground-ruins-monsters.md) manifests to defend the sanctity of this place. It can be placated with a respectful offering.

### Loot
- **On the altar**:
  - A silver chalice (125 gp)
  - A ceremonial dagger with gold inlay (*+1 dagger*, ceremonial but functional)
  - 5 sticks of rare incense (10 gp each)
- **Behind the altar** (DC 16 Investigation):
  - *Periapt of Wound Closure*
  - A sealed stone box containing:
    - *Ring of Protection*
    - 3 gemstones (100 gp each: ruby, sapphire, emerald)
    - A scroll describing a ritual of protection (can be used once to cast *Magic Circle*)
