# Ironridge

> Stone, iron, and smoke: a mountain mining town carved into the high ridges above Ardenford.

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Region** | [Ardenhaven](../../_overview.md) |
| **Type** | Mining Village |
| **Population** | ~200 |
| **Distance from Ardenford** | 15 miles northwest (mountain road) |
| **Primary Industry** | Iron ore mining, stonecutting |
| **Notable Features** | Mine shafts, smelter, mountain road, dwarven quarter |

## Description

Ironridge clings to the mountainside northwest of [Ardenford](ardenford/ardenford.md), a cluster of stone buildings built on terraced platforms carved from the ridge itself. The village exists for one purpose: extracting iron ore and quality stone from the mountain and sending it down to Ardenford's forges.

The air is thin and cold, heavy with smoke from the smelter. Mine shafts tunnel deep into the mountain, reinforced with timber hauled up from the lowlands. A winding mountain road—narrow, steep, dangerous—connects Ironridge to Ardenford below.

A small dwarven community lives here permanently, employed by the mine as engineers and deep-shaft specialists. Their presence is tolerated, even valued, though tensions occasionally flare over pay and working conditions.

## Economy

- **Primary Export:** Iron ore, quality stone (building materials)
- **Secondary:** Smelted iron ingots, coal
- **Trade:** Relies on Ardenford for food, tools, and timber; sends ore down via wagon trains

## Notable Locations

- **The Deep Shafts:** Main mining operation; three levels deep, dwarven-engineered supports
- **The Smelter:** Stone building where ore is processed into rough ingots before transport
- **Mountainside Road:** Steep, narrow wagon road to Ardenford; dangerous in winter
- **Dwarven Quarter:** Small cluster of stone homes housing dwarven miners and their families

## Key NPCs

- **Foreman Stonhar** (Human, late 50s) - Mine overseer; hard, fair, deeply tired
- **Engineer Mokdur** (Dwarf, early 100s) - Lead mining engineer; keeps the deep shafts from collapsing
- **Hauler Brenar** (Human, mid 30s) - Wagon master; drives ore shipments down the mountain road

## Hooks & Rumors

- Miners broke through into an old tunnel last month—sealed it fast and won't talk about what they saw
- Mokdur requested more timber supports than usual; whispers say the deep shafts are "unstable"
- A wagon went over the edge of the mountain road in a storm; some say they heard the driver screaming *after* it fell
