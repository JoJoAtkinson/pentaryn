# Thar'kar Taproom (THAR-kar) — The Valley Guidehouse

A dwarven-run taproom east of Ardenford where people who *know the valley* go to find (or become) the sort of guide you hire when you don’t want to die of weather, distance, or bad assumptions.

## Overview

Thar'kar Taproom isn’t an inn. There are no rooms for rent and no polite encouragement to stay the night. It’s a bar first: hot drink, strong drink, stew when the pot’s on.

It’s also Ardenford’s quiet answer to the question, “Where do I find a sherpa?” You go east—past the busy lanes—until the city thins, the wind changes, and the road starts to feel like it belongs to the valley. That’s where the dwarves gather.

## Where It Is

**Location:** Eastern edge of Ardenford, on the road that drops toward the eastern valley approaches (not far from the last reliable city lamplighters).

People don’t give directions by street name. They say: “Keep walking east until the stone gets older again. Follow the sound of mugs.”

## What It Feels Like

- Built into older stone than the surrounding buildings; soot-darkened ceiling beams; benches heavy enough to be furniture and defense.
- A hand-scratched route board behind the bar: names, distances, warnings, and prices that change with weather.
- Mostly dwarves in work leathers and travel-worn boots, with the occasional human merchant or adventurer trying to look like they belong.

## What You Can Hire Here

Thar'kar isn’t a guild hall, and nobody will call themselves a “sherpa” in polite conversation. But it functions like one.

- **Guides and porters** for eastern valley routes (day-trips to multi-day runs)
- **Trail advice** (paid in drinks, coin, or favors)
- **Gear checks** from people who have strong opinions about rope, boots, and “fancy steel”
- **Introductions** to dwarves who can get you past the first bad decision

## House Rules (Unwritten, Enforced)

- **No boasting about routes you haven’t walked.** You’ll be corrected. Loudly.
- **No hiring a guide to impress someone.** If your reason is stupid, your price doubles.
- **No talking about who you left behind.** The valley takes enough without prying.
