# The Leafscript Cabinet

> **"If the leaf-strokes are wrong, I won’t sell it. If they’re right, I won’t stop talking about it."**

## Overview

The Leafscript Cabinet is a small, tidy shop tucked into the Upper Tier’s scholar-and-scribe lanes, a short walk from the Concordance Library. It stocks *worldly* curios in the way Ardenford understands the word—things that survived travel, trade, and weather—but its heart is unmistakable: elven craftwork, elven language, and anything that smells even faintly of Araethilion.

What makes the place memorable isn’t the wares so much as the proprietor’s devotion. The shelves are labeled twice: once in Common, once in careful (sometimes over-careful) elven script.

## Proprietors

### Khorin Bar’dur (KOH-rin BAR-door)
A native of Ardenford with family ties to the [Dulgarum Oathholds](../../../dulgarum-oathholds/_overview.md), Khorin is a stout, bright-eyed dwarf with ink-stained fingers and the excited cadence of a lecturer who *finally* found someone willing to listen. He collects elven work the way others collect coins: with attention, record-keeping, and a kind of reverence.

Khorin isn’t trying to be elven, and he isn’t infatuated with elves as people. He’s fascinated with the *culture*: the language’s precision, the craft traditions, the way even mundane objects are designed with intent.

### Thessa Kraghammar (THESS-ah KRAG-ham-mer)
Khorin’s wife and business partner. Thessa keeps the accounts, handles supplier arguments, and has perfected the affectionate eye-roll.

She supports Khorin completely—this shop is proof of it—but she does not share his obsession. When he starts explaining the difference between three nearly identical elven suffixes, she’ll nod like it matters, then pivot to what actually matters: payment up front.

## What You Can Buy Here

### Elven staves and simple weapons
Khorin keeps a rotating rack of **quality quarterstaves and walking staves**—balanced hardwoods, wrapped grips, leaf-work carvings, and maker’s marks he can identify at a glance (and will, loudly).

If the party needs an **elven replacement staff**, this is the most straightforward place in Ardenford to find one without waiting on a caravan.

### Worldly curios (small, useful, and labeled)
- Script primers, phrase cards, and copied excerpts of elven poetry (legal copies only—Thessa insists)
- Travel trinkets: carved knots, charm-stones, stamped tokens from distant markets
- Tool-quality oddities: waterproof scroll tubes, map cases, wax-seal kits, field ink

## Tone and Atmosphere

The shop smells faintly of oiled wood, paper, and sealing wax. A little brass bell announces customers. Khorin greets people in Common, then—if they seem receptive—tries a line of elven with careful pronunciation and hopeful eyes.

Thessa greets people with a look that says: *be polite, buy something, don’t encourage him unless you mean it.*

## DM Notes & Hooks

- A “genuine” elven staff on the rack has a maker’s mark Khorin recognizes from a Concordance Library marginal note—tying the object to a named place or expedition.
- Khorin is a safe contact for elven language questions and identification of *craft* (not magic). For enchantments, he’ll send customers to Silverbridge Arcana.
- Thessa quietly assesses people for trouble. If she decides the party is serious, she’ll make sure Khorin offers the *right* options instead of the most interesting lecture.
