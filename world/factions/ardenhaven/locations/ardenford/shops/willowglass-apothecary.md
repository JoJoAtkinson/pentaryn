# Willowglass Apothecary

A narrow shop with green bottles in the window and dried herbs hung like wind-chimes. The name comes from its signature packaging: pale green vials that catch light like river glass.

## Proprietor

Hesta (HESS-tuh) Briarvein (BRY-ur-vayn).

## Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Alchemist / apothecary |
| **Location** | [Ardenford](../ardenford.md) (Middle Tier, near the Western Market lanes) |
| **Affiliation** | Ardenhaven (licensed apothecary; temple-friendly) |

## Shop Offerings

- **Sells:** Poultices, antitoxins (limited), basic healing draughts (when stocked), soaps, salves, incense, remedies for damp-cough and sailor’s rash.
- **Services:** Discreet consultations; poison triage; ingredient appraisal.

## Random Finds (Spell-Counter Stock)

When the party “browses the good shelf,” roll on one table (or pick). Most of this is consumable and meant to feel *slightly odd, but useful*—the kind of thing Hesta can plausibly keep behind the counter without turning her shop into a wizard’s vault.

### Level 1 (d20) — common, always shifting

| d20 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (1st-level):** a practical staple (healing, warding, detection). |
| 2 | **Potion of healing** in Willowglass packaging (green vial, bitter mint). |
| 3 | **Feather-fall charm (single use):** a knotted ribbon you snap to trigger the effect. |
| 4 | **Candle of clean air (1 hour):** burns blue; clears smoke/stink in a small room. |
| 5 | **Scribe’s quick-ink:** enough for one scroll copy attempt; stains fingers violet. |
| 6 | **Witch-salt packet:** neutralizes mundane odors; also ruins certain tracking scents. |
| 7 | **Chalk of warding (10 sticks):** lines glow faintly; good for “don’t cross” marks. |
| 8 | **Antitoxin (limited):** one dose, carefully labeled with the date and batch mark. |
| 9 | **Alchemist’s fire (small flask):** “for spiders and desperation.” |
| 10 | **Smoke pellet (2):** thumb-sized; makes dense, acrid smoke for a moment. |
| 11 | **Sootleaf lozenges:** advantage (DM) on the next performance of “I’m not coughing.” |
| 12 | **Vial of shimmerdust:** reveals fresh footprints and wet handprints for a short while. |
| 13 | **Pocket sachet of calming herbs:** helps with nerves; smells like river reeds. |
| 14 | **Lamp-oil that won’t spill (1 flask):** clings like syrup; hard to ignite accidentally. |
| 15 | **Component pouch refill (pinch-tins):** the boring bits every caster runs out of. |
| 16 | **Thread-seal wax (3 seals):** keeps letters and vials watertight; breaks cleanly. |
| 17 | **Needle-kit of stitchsilver:** mundane sewing kit, but the thread is oddly strong. |
| 18 | **“Truth-bite” tonic:** makes lies taste sour (no compulsion; just a tell). |
| 19 | **Cold-iron shavings (vial):** for circles, ward-lines, or bargaining with the superstitious. |
| 20 | **Customer return:** half-used item at a discount, with a story attached (true or not). |

### Level 2 (d12) — uncommon, behind the counter

| d12 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (2nd-level):** mobility, concealment, or a sharp utility trick. |
| 2 | **Potion of greater healing** (or “strong draft,” if she’s being discreet). |
| 3 | **Darkvision draught (8 hours):** tastes like burnt citrus; leaves black tongue. |
| 4 | **Invisibility “blink” smoke (single use):** works only if you hold your breath. |
| 5 | **Lesser restoration poultice:** ugly smell; works fast if applied immediately. |
| 6 | **Silvered needle + ink:** enough to mark one weapon with a temporary sigil (1 fight). |
| 7 | **Jar of crawling-moss:** used to quiet footsteps on stone when rubbed in. |
| 8 | **Two-way whisper thread (10 minutes):** tied between two points; carries murmurs. |
| 9 | **Sealing resin:** closes a door/window seam as if “never opened” (until cut). |
| 10 | **Philter of love** (rarely sold; Hesta questions buyers pointedly). |
| 11 | **Scroll-case of dryglass:** keeps paper safe even if dunked in the river. |
| 12 | **“Ward-coin” charm:** grants a brief protective flicker when you’re hit (single use). |

### Level 3 (d8) — rare-ish, usually by request

| d8 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (3rd-level):** serious magic; she asks *why* you need it. |
| 2 | **Potion of superior healing** (if available) or a batch note promising it “tomorrow.” |
| 3 | **Water-breathing pearls (2):** dissolve on the tongue; tastes like saltstone. |
| 4 | **Dust of disappearance** (small pouch): leaves a faint green sparkle in lamplight. |
| 5 | **Circle-chalk (1 use):** pre-mixed for a simple ward circle; brittle, expensive. |
| 6 | **“Stitch of silence” thread (10 minutes):** sewn/knotted into cloth to damp sound. |
| 7 | **Ghost-lantern wick:** makes a lantern show invisible smears and warm-blooded breath. |
| 8 | **Tonic of borrowed luck:** one reroll, then a minor mishap later (DM chooses). |

### Level 4 (d6) — very rare in the shop

| d6 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (4th-level):** sealed with temple wax and a name you don’t recognize. |
| 2 | **Potion of vitality** (or a “heart-strong draft,” if she won’t name it). |
| 3 | **Stone-skin salve (1 application):** gritty; makes the skin feel like river rock. |
| 4 | **Glass bead of scry-warding:** cracks if someone tries to watch you magically (once). |
| 5 | **Phial of slowtime syrup:** briefly dulls speed and panic in a small area (DM adjudicates). |
| 6 | **Reagent: night-bloom distillate:** only sold with a favor or a warning attached. |

### Level 5 (d4) — almost never on the shelf

| d4 | Find |
|---:|---|
| 1 | **Spell scroll (5th-level):** not displayed; requires a private conversation. |
| 2 | **Potion of supreme healing** (extremely rare; likely spoken-for). |
| 3 | **“Last-ditch” revival kit:** sealed bundle of reagents; Hesta refuses casual buyers. |
| 4 | **True-name ink (one dose):** writing burns slightly; attracts attention if misused. |

## Hesta (Quick Notes)

- **Traits:** Warm, no-nonsense, sharply observant of symptoms and lies.
- **Ideals:** Help first; blame later.
- **Bonds:** Keeps a quiet arrangement with a temple medic to refer cases she can’t handle alone.
- **Flaws:** Hoards information “just in case”; will downplay danger until she’s sure she’s right.

## Using in Play

- **Quest hook:** Someone is buying up winter-bloom and lamp-oil in odd ratios. Hesta suspects a firetrap or a crude alchemical explosive—and wants proof before she alarms the watch.
- **What she knows:** Which neighborhoods are getting sicker, who’s coming in with “ruin dust” burns, and which mercenaries aren’t washing blood off their boots.
