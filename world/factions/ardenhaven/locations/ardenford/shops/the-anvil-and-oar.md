# The Anvil & Oar

Ardenford’s most reliable working weaponsmith: practical steel, fair prices, and a hard rule against “hero blades” that will get someone killed.

## Proprietor

Branik Ironweld.

## Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Weaponsmith / armorer |
| **Location** | [Ardenford](../ardenford.md) (Lower Tier, just off the harbor lanes) |
| **Affiliation** | Ardenhaven (licensed smith; guild-adjacent) |

## The Shop

A narrow-front smithy wedged between net-menders and rope sellers, with a forge vent that always smells faintly of salt. The sign is simple: a stamped iron anvil crossed with an oar.

- **Sells:** Spearheads, short swords, axes, daggers, crossbow bolts, repair work, simple armor fittings.
- **Known for:** “Harbor-tempered” blades (really: sensible heat treatment and a lot of experience with damp air).

## Branik (Quick Notes)

- **Traits:** Blunt, steady, surprisingly patient with apprentices.
- **Ideals:** Tools should outlast pride.
- **Bonds:** His sister runs a fish stall in the Northern Market; he keeps her debts quiet and paid.
- **Flaws:** Overly suspicious of “adventurer craftsmanship”; assumes every request is a scam until proven otherwise.

## Using in Play

- **Quest hook:** Branik’s last shipment of charcoal vanished between the Middle Tier switchbacks. He refuses to shut down for a “merchant dispute” but can’t keep the forge hot without it.
- **What he knows:** Harbor gossip, who’s buying too many spearheads, and which guards look the other way for coin.
