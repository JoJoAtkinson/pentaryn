# The Wayward Compass

Ardenford's fastest—and most discreet—courier service. If you need a message delivered, a package moved quietly, or someone found in the city's maze of tiers, the Wayward Compass will get it done.

## Proprietor

**Barnaby** - Head courier and dispatcher

## Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Courier service / message runners |
| **Location** | [Ardenford](../ardenford.md) (Middle Tier, near the tier switchbacks) |
| **Affiliation** | Ardenhaven (licensed courier guild) |

## The Shop

A narrow storefront with a hand-painted compass rose above the door—deliberately off by a few degrees, as if the needle wandered. Inside: a dispatch counter, a wall of cubbyholes for held messages, and a chalkboard listing rates and delivery times.

The back room is always bustling: runners coming and going, boots clattering on stairs, and Barnaby orchestrating the chaos with hand signals and whistle codes.

- **Services:** Message delivery (same-day, express, scheduled), package transport (small items only), person-finding (for a fee), discreet delivery (no questions asked, higher rates).
- **Known for:** Speed, reliability, and an unspoken policy of not reading the messages they carry.

## Key NPCs

### Barnaby (Quick Notes)

- **Traits:** Fast-talking, perpetually in motion, knows every shortcut and back alley in Ardenford.
- **Ideals:** "A message delivered is a promise kept."
- **Bonds:** He owes his success to the street urchins and dock workers who taught him the city's hidden routes.
- **Flaws:** Can't resist gossip—he won't read your message, but he'll definitely notice who's sending messages to whom.

### Mokdur (Compass-Wright)

- **Role:** Dwarf craftsman who maintains the compass sign and creates navigation tools for the runners.
- **Traits:** Meticulous, grumbles about "shoddy human craftsmanship," secretly proud when his tools help save lives.
- **Services:** Repairs compasses, creates custom map cases, etches route markers, and adds clever compartments to courier bags.
- **Workshop:** A cramped space in the back corner, smelling of oil and brass filings, where he mutters over tiny gears and calibration needles.

## Rates

- **Standard delivery (within tier):** 1 sp
- **Cross-tier delivery:** 5 sp
- **Express (within 1 hour):** 1 gp
- **Discreet delivery (no records kept):** 5 gp
- **Person-finding:** 2 gp + 5 sp per hour of search time

## Using in Play

- **Quest hook:** Barnaby's newest runner vanished while delivering a package to the Upper Tier. The client is demanding answers, but Barnaby suspects foul play—the package was addressed to someone who "doesn't exist."
- **What he knows:** Who's sending messages where, patterns in delivery requests, which parts of the city are suddenly "too dangerous" for runners, and who pays extra for discretion.
- **Services for PCs:** The Wayward Compass can deliver messages to NPCs, track down hard-to-find contacts, or provide intel on city movement patterns.
