# Elarion Faenwynd (eh-LAR-ee-on FAYN-wind)

An elven archivist and quiet political operator embedded in Ardenford’s Concordance Library—officially to preserve history, unofficially to keep an eye on what the ruins are starting to say.

## Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Race** | High Elf |
| **Role** | Archivist / translator / discreet courier |
| **Alignment** | Neutral Good |
| **Location** | [Ardenford](../locations/ardenford.md) (Concordance Library, Upper Tier) |
| **Affiliation** | [Araethilion](../../araethilion/_overview.md); Ardenhaven (guest scholar, charter-recognized) |
| **Languages** | Elvish (fluent), Common (fluent), Draconic (reading), Celestial (basic) |

## Appearance

Tall and spare, with sea-dark hair worn in a tight braid and ink-stained fingertips he never quite manages to scrub clean. His eyes are a pale storm-gray that reads as cold until he smiles—then they’re simply tired. He dresses plainly for an elf: layered wool, a long coat cut for wind, and a single silver pin shaped like a bridged arch.

## Personality

- **Traits:** Patient, observant, politely stubborn; asks gentle questions that feel like nothing until later.
- **Ideals:** History is a public trust. If knowledge becomes property, power becomes a cage.
- **Bonds:** Owes Magister Merrick a debt for granting him real access; maintains a correspondence with an Araethilion patron he won’t name.
- **Flaws:** Keeps secrets “for everyone’s good”; will delay action to confirm a detail that feels *almost* complete.

## Current Role in Ardenford

- Maintains a ruin-catalog ledger for expeditions that file reports with the library.
- Translates older tablets and inscriptions when the script isn’t immediately human-readable.
- Quietly connects petitioners and scholars to the right councillor, clerk, or guild contact—never taking credit.

## Using Elarion in Play

- **First impression:** Courteous, reserved, unhurried. He makes time for people who make time for the truth.
- **What he wants from the party:** A copy of field-notes from a ruin site that “shouldn’t exist” according to the archive maps.
- **What he can offer:** Research access, introductions, a translation in the margin that changes what a “warning” actually means.

## Secret / Plot Hook

Elarion has identified a repeating phrase in several unrelated ruin fragments that does not match any known human dialect. He suspects it’s an **elven-era waypoint marker**—which would imply the ruins under Ardenford were *visited* (or *built upon*) by someone who knew the old paths.

If the Council learns this, it becomes politics. If Araethilion learns it, it becomes an expedition. Elarion is trying—carefully—to make it become **the party’s choice** first.
