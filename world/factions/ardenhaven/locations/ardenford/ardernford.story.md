# Ardenford

> You smell Ardenford before you see it: salt and fish on the wind, tar and canvas, fresh bread and leather, and the cold, clean bite of old stone. Then the city comes into view—no ring of walls, no single crown of a castle—just a sprawling climb of rooftops and ruin-work, rising from the northern sea in three uneven tiers.

Ardenford sits where mountain meets water, built directly atop—and into—the remains of an ancient, unnamed civilization. Weathered foundations decide where streets run; broken columns become doorframes. Streams spill down from the eastern ridge, cutting narrow channels through the city before finding the harbor, and the gulls ensuring their presence is known. 

To outsiders, Ardenford can look like a mistake that somehow survived: streets that refuse to line up, staircases that appear where they have no right to be, buildings pressed shoulder-to-shoulder in mismatched styles. To the people who live here, it is simply home—busy, loud, stubbornly free, and always alive.

## The City of Three Tiers

### Lower Tier: Harbor District

The Lower Tier is sea-slick stone and constant motion. Fishing boats knock against dock pilings; shipwrights argue over rope and sailcloth; warehouse doors yawn open to swallow crates of salted herring and spit out barrels of tar. The streets here taste of brine, and on windy days ocean spray reaches far enough inland to bead on shop windows.

The Northern Market sprawls along the docks like a living thing. There are no tidy rows—just carts, tables, crates, and loud voices carving temporary paths through the crowd. Fishermen auction their catch straight off the boats. Merchants hawk imported spices, metalwork, and strange little trinkets. Gulls dive for scraps. If you hesitate, you will be jostled; if you haggle poorly, you will overpay.

Looking out over it all is Tidemark Hold—low and sturdy, more storm-break than fortress. It keeps watch on customs and harbor defense, quiet until it suddenly isn’t.

### Middle Tier: Trade and Homes

The climb into the Middle Tier is a test of legs and patience: steep switchback roads, ancient staircases worn smooth by centuries, tight corners where carts pass with inches to spare. Locals move through it like water in a channel, leaning into the wind without breaking stride. Newcomers flatten themselves against walls, wide-eyed at the wheels and the drop to the sea below.

This is where most of Ardenford lives. Workshops clatter with work—tanneries, bookbinders, craftsmen of every stripe. Small squares hold clusters of neighbors trading gossip and news. The Western Market anchors the tier near the foothill farmlands: wagons of grain and vegetables, livestock penned in temporary lines, and permanent tannery stalls that smell so sharply you’ll swear it’s staining your clothes. Here the shouting softens into negotiation; names are remembered; extra apples appear in a widow’s basket as if by accident.

If you’re looking for a place to put down your pack, you’ll hear the same advice from more than one mouth: find the Wayward Compass.

### Upper Tier: Ridge District

The Upper Tier is wind and wide views. From here you can see the whole city spilled below you and the northern sea beyond, slate-colored and endless. The ancient ruins show their bones more openly on the ridge—structures barely modified, stonework older than any living memory, weathered glyphs no one can translate.

The Concordance Library sits here, built into and around a partially intact ancient structure. Inside, the city’s noise fades into reverent quiet: leather bindings, old paper, sunlight through tall windows, and scholars bent over maps and treaties as if the ink might still be warm.

Keeps also rise along the ridge and its edges—fortified complexes rather than a single lord’s castle—each with its own purpose, each ready to become part of the city’s defense if war ever comes again.

## Keeps on the Ridges

Ardenford has no throne and no single crown of stone. Instead it has keeps: Harrowick Keep with its drill yards and clear sightlines to sea and valley; Brennick Hall, elegant enough to host councils and guests; the Greystone Granaries, thick-walled warehouses built around an ancient tower, a memorial plaque catching light on the stone; and Vintara House, a training ground and watchtowers where professional mercenaries keep their edge.

The names matter less than the pattern: Ardenford does not hide behind walls. It trusts the mountain, the height, the choke points between tiers, and the speed of people who know every stair and alley by heart.

## Old Stone, Older Stories

Everywhere in Ardenford, the past refuses to stay buried. An ancient wall can be the side of a tavern. A carved foundation can turn a street straight for twenty paces before it twists again. Children play atop stones that once meant something sacred to a people whose name is gone.

And if you linger long enough—if you listen in taverns, if you ask the wrong question at the wrong time—you’ll hear talk of the tunnels beneath the city. Veterans mention them with the flat tone of those who remember wartime. Newcomers argue about them like a puzzle they’ve been denied. Locals shrug, as if it’s just another door that doesn’t open.

What is public is simple: the ruins outside the city are fair game, and the ruins under Ardenford are not.

## The Wayward Compass

> **"We all find our way here eventually."**

The Wayward Compass sits where three streets collide at odd angles—an intersection that makes no sense until you’ve lived with it. Its sign, a battered brass compass rose, swings lazily in the sea breeze. The building is stone and timber, grown around an ancient ruin wall that forms one entire side of the common room, carvings worn down to faint geometry.

Inside is warmth and noise: woodsmoke, roasted meat, and the steady hum of too many conversations at once. Heavy tables scarred by decades crowd the floor. A fireplace of massive stone pumps heat into the room. Somewhere, dice clatter—Bones & Blades, the locals will tell you, and then refuse to explain the rules until you sit down with a coin or some marks. 

Torren Ashvale owns the place: a retired soldier, graying, competent, with a slight limp and a way of watching the room without making a show of it. The Compass has an unspoken rule—leave your disputes outside—and most people are wise enough to obey. Near the bar a notice board collects requests, bounties, and odd jobs, the sort of work that keeps a city like Ardenford fed and safe.

## The Concordance Library

> **"All that we were, all that we might become."**

Up on the ridge, the Concordance Library holds Ardenhaven’s memory in ink and vellum. Treaties sit under glass. War records stack in careful order. Maps of trade routes and known ruin sites invite both scholarship and foolishness.

Magister Ellyn Merrick oversees the collection, stern and protective in equal measure. She believes knowledge should be shared rather than hoarded—provided you handle it with respect. Scholars come to study the ancient ruins. Apprentices come to learn. Adventurers come for maps and old reports, hoping to find what others missed and avoid what killed them.

## The Rhythm of Ardenford

Ardenford wakes all at once. At dawn the harbor shouts and the markets roar to life; bakers light ovens and smoke rises in a thousand thin lines. By midday the city is at its loudest—workshops clanging, carts rattling, negotiations and arguments blooming on every corner. Evening softens the pace into taverns and music. At night the city doesn’t sleep so much as it breathes more quietly: torchlight on the docks, lovers in shadowed stairwells, the crash of waves growing louder as other sounds fade.

It never looks orderly. It never feels dead. Beneath the chaos is a kind of muscle memory—a shared understanding of routes, wind gusts, shortcuts, and the unwritten rules that keep fifty thousand people from turning their freedom into violence.

## Adventurers, Welcome (Mostly)

Four years ago, the Council of Consuls passed the Ruins Reclamation Act: any treasure or artifacts found in ruins outside the city belong to the finder. Since then, adventurers have come in a steady stream—treasure hunters and sellswords with empty pockets and sharp opinions.

Merchants and innkeepers tend to love them. Scholars appreciate what they bring back. Guards at keeps tolerate them so long as boundaries are respected. Farmers are wary, veterans are judgmental, and parents keep children close when a band of armed strangers laughs too loudly.

And always, somewhere in the noise, the same argument resurfaces: if distant ruins are fair game, why not the tunnels under Ardenford? The debate rarely ends in more than bruised pride and spilled ale—but it never really goes away, either.

## Ardenford in ᛏ250

It has been 127 years since the Compact of Unity, 127 years since the Pentarch Accords ended the war, and four years since the Reclamation Act changed who comes to Ardenford and why. The city is optimistic but watchful. Trade expands. New buildings rise on ancient foundations. The markets bustle.

Ardenford is alive—chaotic, thriving, and defiantly free.
