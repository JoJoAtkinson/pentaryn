# Rella Dunsford (REL-uh DUNS-ford) — Harrowick Keep Training Office

The person who answers the east-facing service door at odd hours, takes in contractors without fuss, and makes sure the trainees never see the setup.

## Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Role** | Training Office clerk (operations, scheduling, contractor handling) |
| **Alignment** | Lawful Neutral |
| **Location** | Harrowick Keep (Ardenford) |
| **Affiliation** | Ardenhaven (Harrowick Keep; Rapid Response Companies) |
| **Languages** | Common |

## Appearance

Neat uniform, ink-stained fingertips, hair pinned back for practicality. Moves like someone who has learned to be invisible in busy corridors.

## Personality

- **Traits:** Quietly efficient, unflappable, dry humor when the door is shut.
- **Ideals:** Readiness is built in the small routines.
- **Bonds:** Harrowick’s trainees (she complains about them; she protects them).
- **Flaws:** Treats everything like a checklist; can sound cold when she’s actually being careful.

## What Rella Does

- **Side-door intake:** Keeps contractors out of sight, gets them briefed, and sends them to the right waiting room or storage bay.
- **Paperwork and cover stories:** “Deliveries,” “maintenance,” “inventory inspection,” or “clerk’s errand,” depending on who asks.
- **Exercise control:** Issues exercise tokens, tracks names, and has the authority to halt the drill if it goes wrong.

## What She Knows

- The day’s training routes and which squads are being run (without advertising it).
- Which guards can be trusted not to gossip.
- Which trainees are reckless, which are timid, and which are likely to freeze.

## Using Rella in Play

- If the party shows up early, she will tuck them somewhere boring and out of the way, then deliver a last-minute briefing like it’s a grocery list.
- If the party shows up late, she will still take them—then quietly dock them in reputation, not pay.
- If the party asks about the Imperium, she redirects: “Not our business. Not our brief.”
