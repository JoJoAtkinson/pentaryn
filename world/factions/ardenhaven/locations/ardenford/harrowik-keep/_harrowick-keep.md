# Harrowick Keep

> A stark training fortress on Ardenford’s Upper Tier, built into old ruin-stone and tasked with keeping the city’s Rapid Response Companies sharp.

## Overview

Harrowick Keep sits on the Upper Tier’s northeastern edge, where the wind comes in clean off the northern sea and the ridge gives long sightlines over harbor and valley approaches. It is functional rather than impressive: drill yards, stables, barracks, armories, and watch platforms that prioritize speed and clarity over ceremony.

The keep was funded by the federal government after the war and is treated as a working institution first and foremost. In peacetime, its companies patrol the borderlands, escort caravans, and run training cycles that rotate recruits through city terrain and open country.

## Purpose

- **Training and readiness** for one of Ardenford’s primary Rapid Response Companies
- **Rapid deployment** to border threats, raid alerts, and emergency reinforcement between tiers
- **Discipline under uncertainty**: Harrowick’s doctrine favors mobility, initiative, and city-savvy problem solving over static defense

## Notable Areas

### Outer Drill Yard
The public-facing yard: where contractors report, recruits run formation drills, and instructors make examples out of sloppy footwork. It’s also the first place you’ll feel how seriously Harrowick treats control: lines, timing, and clear orders.

### Training Office
A small administrative suite that handles schedules, requisitions, and outside contracts. Paperwork is brisk, stamped, and annoyingly precise.

### Stables and Tack Rows
Mounted patrols and messengers live here. The tack rows are kept immaculate; anyone who leaves gear in disarray earns a reputation fast.

## Access and Protocol

Harrowick is not a tourist location. Entry is normal for a working keep: questioned at the gate, directed where you’re allowed, and watched until you leave. Adventurers are tolerated when they’re useful.

Contractors are common enough that Harrowick has procedures for them—briefings, rules of engagement, a designated liaison, and a clear understanding that the keep will not protect anyone who “went too far” and then tried to blame the work.

## Plot Hooks

- A training exercise turns into something real when an unrelated threat uses the chaos as cover.
- A recruit begs the party to take it easy—then fights like someone who’s terrified of being found out.
- The keep quietly blacklists a local crew; the party gets hired as an alternative because they’re unknown.
