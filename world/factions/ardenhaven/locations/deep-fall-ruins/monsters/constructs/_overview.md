# Deep Fall Ruins — Constructs

Homebrew constructs for the Deep Fall Ruins. These are written as **solo-style** CR 3 threats meant to feel ancient and dangerous in tight corridors.

## Wild Constructs (broken / cohered by old magic)

- [Wild Arc-Scaffold Golem](wild-arc-scaffold-golem.md) — lightning-held scrapframe; pulls metal-clad prey close.
- [Wild Spore-Stitched Colossus](wild-spore-stitched-colossus.md) — fungus-bound brute; poisons and blinds with old spores.
- [Wild Unmade Effigy](wild-unmade-effigy.md) — a “construct that shouldn’t exist”; floating shards orbit a hungry void.

## Guardians (whole / still doing their job)

- [Guardian Gateward Sentinel](guardian-gateward-sentinel.md) — threshold keeper; locks movement and punishes door-rushers.
- [Guardian Vault Lantern](guardian-vault-lantern.md) — hovering wardlight; marks intruders and flash-blinds.
- [Guardian Chain-Anchor Warden](guardian-chain-anchor-warden.md) — chained to its post; grapples and reels targets into kill range.
