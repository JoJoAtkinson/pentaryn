# Wild Unmade Effigy (WYL'd un-MAYD EF-ih-jee)

> The ruins tried to remember a guardian—and failed. Now the failure floats: shards orbiting a void that *wants* to be a body.

**Type:** Medium construct (homebrew)  
**Challenge:** 3 (700 XP) *(target)*

## Traits

- **Construct Nature.** The effigy doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Unmade Form.** The effigy can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. It can’t end its movement inside a creature or object.

## Actions

- **Multiattack.** The effigy makes two **Orbiting Shard** attacks.
- **Orbiting Shard.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 60/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 2) force damage.
- **Unmaking Wave (Recharge 6).** The effigy exhales a cone of hollow pressure. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

## DM Notes (How It Feels)

- **Ancient tells:** the plates carry old dwarven maker-marks; the void between them is *too clean* for the Deep Fall Ruins.
- **Best terrain:** broken stairwells, open chasms, rooms with lots of cover (the effigy ignores most of it by hovering and threading gaps).
- **Scare factor:** describe the sound as “air being erased.”
