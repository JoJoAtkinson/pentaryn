# Wild Arc-Scaffold Golem (WYL'd ARK-SKAF-old GOH-lum)

> It is not a body so much as a *framework*: snapped dwarf-scaffolds, riveted plates, and broken tools tied together by blue arcs that refuse to let go.

**Type:** Large construct (homebrew)  
**Challenge:** 3 (700 XP) *(target)*

## Traits

- **Construct Nature.** The golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Arc Cohesion.** If the golem would take lightning damage, it takes no damage instead and regains hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.
- **Conductive Drag.** When the golem hits a creature with an **Arc Lash**, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet straight toward the golem.

## Actions

- **Multiattack.** The golem makes two **Arc Lash** attacks.
- **Arc Lash.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (1d8 + 4 bludgeoning plus 1d6 lightning) damage.
- **Overcharge (Recharge 5–6).** The golem detonates in a crackling burst. Each creature of the golem’s choice within 10 feet must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on this save.

## DM Notes (How It Feels)

- **Ancient tells:** the arcs “jump” across runes that no longer exist; the golem pauses mid-fight as if waiting for an order that never comes.
- **Best terrain:** narrow bridges, doorways, ladder shafts—anywhere the pull matters.
- **Scare factor:** announce the *sound* first: a distant, steady clicking as the arcs “count” time.
