## Traits

- **Construct Nature.** The sentinel doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Bound to the Threshold.** The sentinel can’t willingly move more than 30 feet from its post (usually a door, arch, or sigil-plinth). If forced beyond that range, it immediately stops moving and returns to the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet.
- **Sentinel.** When the sentinel hits with an opportunity attack, the target’s speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

## Actions

- **Multiattack.** The sentinel makes two **Slam** attacks.
- **Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Gatebar (Recharge 5–6).** The sentinel stamps its foot and flares sigil-light. Each enemy creature within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the guarded threshold and knocked prone. On a success, a creature isn’t pushed or knocked prone.

## DM Notes (How It Feels)

- **Ancient tells:** the threshold sigils are worn smooth where countless hands once touched them for blessing.
- **Best terrain:** doors, bridges, narrow halls—anything that makes getting past it the real objective.
- **Bypass angle (optional):** an ancient “passphrase” or sequence etched nearby can pause the sentinel for 1 minute (until it’s attacked). Use this as a reward for careful exploration, not a gotcha.
