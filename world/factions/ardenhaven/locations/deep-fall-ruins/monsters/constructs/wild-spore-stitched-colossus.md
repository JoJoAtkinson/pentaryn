## Traits

- **Construct Nature.** The colossus doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Spore-Sutured Frame.** When the colossus is first reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, it immediately releases spores (no action): each creature within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.

## Actions

- **Multiattack.** The colossus makes two **Slam** attacks.
- **Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Browncap Sporeburst (Recharge 5–6).** The colossus vents a choking cloud in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 13 (3d8) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. The area is heavily obscured until the start of the colossus’s next turn.

## DM Notes (How It Feels)

- **Ancient tells:** dwarven runes remain on the stone—half eaten by fungus, half rewritten by time.
- **Best terrain:** mushroom forests, low ceilings, tight halls where the obscuring cloud matters.
- **Scare factor:** the spores don’t look like “gas”—they look like *memory* shaking loose.
