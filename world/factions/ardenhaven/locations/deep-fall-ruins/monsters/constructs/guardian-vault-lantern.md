# Guardian Vault Lantern (GAR-dee-un VAWLT LAN-tern)

> It floats without chains. Its light is warm, wrong, and watchful—like a hearth that remembers who is not family.

## Traits

- **Construct Nature.** The lantern doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Wardlight.** The lantern sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. As a bonus action, it can reduce the bright light to dim light (20 feet) or restore it.
- **Vaultmark.** When the lantern hits a creature with a **Wardlight Beam**, it can choose to mark the creature until the end of the lantern’s next turn. A marked creature can’t benefit from being invisible, and it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius.

## Actions

- **Multiattack.** The lantern makes two **Wardlight Beam** attacks.
- **Wardlight Beam.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) radiant damage.
- **Flash-Seal (Recharge 5–6).** The lantern flares like a forge-door opening. Each creature of the lantern’s choice within 15 feet must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

## DM Notes (How It Feels)

- **Ancient tells:** soot-blackened panels, repaired with mismatched rivets; the light never flickers the same way twice.
- **Best terrain:** vault antechambers, long corridors, ledges over darkness.
- **Scare factor:** call out the *marking* first—players hate losing stealth more than losing hit points.
