# Guardian Chain-Anchor Warden (GAR-dee-un CHAYN ANG-ker WOR-dn)

## Traits

- **Construct Nature.** The warden doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Anchored to Its Post.** The warden can’t willingly move more than 20 feet from its anchor point (usually a door-ring, pillar, or floor-bolt). If it would be moved beyond that range, the chain goes taut and the warden stops in the nearest unoccupied space within 20 feet.
- **Relentless Reel.** At the start of the warden’s turn, each creature grappled by it is pulled up to 10 feet straight toward the warden.

## Actions

- **Multiattack.** The warden makes two **Chain Lash** attacks.
- **Chain Lash.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (1d8 + 4 bludgeoning plus 1d6 piercing) damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.
- **Anchor Slam (Recharge 5–6).** The warden hammers its anchor into the stone. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also knocked prone.
