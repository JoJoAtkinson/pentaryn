# Violet Fungus (CR 1/4)

**Slug:** `violet-fungus`

## DM Use

- Stationary melee hazard that makes tight corridors and “stand and fight” tactics risky.
- Works well as **terrain** in a bigger combat: moving through the wrong square hurts.

## Encounter Seeds

- A violet fungus ring around a half-collapsed altar or idol (as if it’s “guarding” it).
- Fungus patches in a low-ceiling crawlspace where swinging weapons is awkward.
