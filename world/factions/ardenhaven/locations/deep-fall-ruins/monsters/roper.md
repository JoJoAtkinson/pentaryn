# Roper (CR 5)

**Slug:** `roper`

## DM Use

- Stalactite horror; turns “safe distance” into a lie with reach and control.
- Likes **verticality**: chasms, ledges, broken stairwells, sinkholes.

## Encounter Seeds

- A roper guarding a “natural bridge” the derro avoid (because it eats them too).
- A roper that has learned to mimic the silhouette of an old dwarven hoist.
