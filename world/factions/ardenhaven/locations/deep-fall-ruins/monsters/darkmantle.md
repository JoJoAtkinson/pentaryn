# Darkmantle (CR 1/2)

**Slug:** `darkmantle`

## DM Use

- Ceiling ambusher; fights best in cramped tunnels or over drop-offs.
- Pair with **noise** (dripping water, distant derro chatter) so the “living stalactite” surprise feels fair.

## Encounter Seeds

- Hanging above a narrow stone bridge; first PC to cross gets hit, then the rest fight in panic on the ledge.
- A darkmantle nest near warm vents where bats and blind fish gather.
