# Deathcap Myconid (CR 4)

**Slug:** `deathcap-myconid`

## DM Use

- Makes fungus caverns feel like a **thinking ecosystem**, not just set dressing.
- Great as a “boss of the spore” encounter in a mushroom forest with concealment and choke points.

## Encounter Seeds

- A deathcap myconid that has claimed a derro dump-site as “soil” and defends it violently.
- A spore court that “judges” intruders by whether they carry rot, blood, or fire.
