# Shrieker (CR 0)

**Slug:** `shrieker`

## DM Use

- Living alarm bell. Use to create **time pressure** and make stealth feel meaningful.
- Put it near things that matter: gates, choke points, caches, ritual spaces.

## Encounter Seeds

- A shrieker patch wired into derro patrol routes (accidentally or intentionally).
- A shrieker “garden” bordering a spore cavern: anyone fighting near it risks calling worse things.
