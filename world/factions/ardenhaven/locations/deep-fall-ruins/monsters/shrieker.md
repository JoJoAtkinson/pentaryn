### Traits

- **False Appearance.** While the shrieker remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary fungus.

### Actions

- **Shriek.** When bright light or a creature is within 30 feet of the shrieker, it emits a shriek audible within 300 feet of it. The shrieker continues to shriek until the disturbance moves out of range and for 1d4 of the shrieker's turns afterward.

## DM Use

- Living alarm bell. Use to create **time pressure** and make stealth feel meaningful.
- Put it near things that matter: gates, choke points, caches, ritual spaces.

## Encounter Seeds

- A shrieker patch wired into derro patrol routes (accidentally or intentionally).
- A shrieker “garden” bordering a spore cavern: anyone fighting near it risks calling worse things.
