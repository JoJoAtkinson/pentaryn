- **Water Breathing.** The swarm can breathe only underwater.

### Actions

- **Bites.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or 7 (2d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

## DM Use

- Turns any fall into water into a panic moment.
- Best used as a **hazard** that forces repositioning while another threat pressures the party.

## Encounter Seeds

- Quippers in a flooded trench beneath an “easy” crossing.
- Quippers released from a broken derro holding pen as a distraction.
