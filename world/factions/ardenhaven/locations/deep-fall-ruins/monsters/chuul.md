# Chuul (CR 4)

**Slug:** `chuul`

## DM Use

- Perfect for brackish caverns and flooded tunnels: **grab + drag** into water, isolate targets, force hard choices.
- Make the water matter: slippery edges, sudden drop, half-submerged rubble.

## Encounter Seeds

- A chuul living in an old cistern where derro dump bodies (and sometimes stolen gear).
- A chuul nest in a flooded shrine; the “safe” stepping stones are exactly where it can reach.
