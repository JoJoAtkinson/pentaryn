### Traits

- **Amphibious.** The chuul can breathe air and water.
- **Sense Magic.** The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the *detect magic* spell but isn't itself magical.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.
- **Pincer.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn't have two other creatures grappled.
- **Tentacles.** One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## DM Use

- Perfect for brackish caverns and flooded tunnels: **grab + drag** into water, isolate targets, force hard choices.
- Make the water matter: slippery edges, sudden drop, half-submerged rubble.

## Encounter Seeds

- A chuul living in an old cistern where derro dump bodies (and sometimes stolen gear).
- A chuul nest in a flooded shrine; the “safe” stepping stones are exactly where it can reach.
