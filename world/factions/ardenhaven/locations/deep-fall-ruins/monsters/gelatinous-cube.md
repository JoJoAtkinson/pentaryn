# Gelatinous Cube (CR 2)

**Slug:** `gelatinous-cube`

## DM Use

- Classic corridor hazard; best when the party is already tense (low light, narrow passage, time pressure).
- Telegraphed by **suspiciously clean stone**, half-dissolved gear, or bones suspended at odd heights.

## Encounter Seeds

- A “clean hallway” leading into an old vault (the cube has been polishing it for years).
- A cube kept (barely) contained behind a broken portcullis as an improvised derro “trap.”
