# Grick (CR 2)

**Slug:** `grick`

## DM Use

- “Tunnel stalker” that pressures the backline and punishes marching order mistakes.
- Great in areas with lots of **stone pillars** or broken masonry for half-cover and sudden angles.

## Encounter Seeds

- A grick that has learned to follow derro patrol routes for scraps.
- Old dwarven support-beams turned to rubble—gricks use the gaps like burrows.
