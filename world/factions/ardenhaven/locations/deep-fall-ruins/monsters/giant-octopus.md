### Traits

- **Hold Breath.** While out of water, the octopus can hold its breath for 1 hour.
- **Underwater Camouflage.** The octopus has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while underwater.
- **Water Breathing.** The octopus can breathe only underwater.

### Actions

- **Tentacles.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the octopus can't use its tentacles on another target.
- **Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** A 20-foot-radius cloud of ink extends all around the octopus if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the octopus can use the Dash action as a bonus action.

## DM Use

- Great “pull the party under” threat without feeling supernatural.
- Works best with **limited visibility**: silt clouds, algae bloom, phosphorescent patches.

## Encounter Seeds

- An underground pool with a tempting cache on a half-submerged platform.
- A narrow flooded squeeze where the octopus can block retreat.
