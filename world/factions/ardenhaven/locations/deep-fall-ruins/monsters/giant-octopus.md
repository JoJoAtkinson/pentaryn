# Giant Octopus (CR 1)

**Slug:** `giant-octopus`

## DM Use

- Great “pull the party under” threat without feeling supernatural.
- Works best with **limited visibility**: silt clouds, algae bloom, phosphorescent patches.

## Encounter Seeds

- An underground pool with a tempting cache on a half-submerged platform.
- A narrow flooded squeeze where the octopus can block retreat.
