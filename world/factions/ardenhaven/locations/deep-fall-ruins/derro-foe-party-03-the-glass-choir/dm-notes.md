# DM Notes — The Glass Choir

## Combat Cheat Sheet

### What makes them feel different

- Their “wizard” is a **sound-relic** (Resonant Bell-Helm), not scrolls and not darkness.
- They weaponize **silence** to shut down casters and stop verbal callouts.
- Their mobs fight like a crew that practiced in echo tunnels: **hold angles**, punish movement.

### Default Battlefield Plan

- Pick a space with **hard surfaces**: stone halls, vaulted chambers, bridges over water.
- Open by placing **Silence** on the party’s backline (or on the biggest caster).
- Use hooks + caltrops to keep PCs in the worst square possible.

### Round 1 Script

1) **Thrumzok-dum:** Bell-Helm → **Silence Cage** (if the party has casters), otherwise **Shatterburst** (if clustered).
2) **Dulgrin-kar:** engages the first frontliner and uses **Glass Parry** to stay standing.
3) **Khorvul-dur:** hooks and drags a target into a crossfire lane.
4) **Skulkers:** focus-fire whoever is isolated or whoever is trying to concentrate.
5) **Glasscutters:** swarm anyone prone/restrained and then scatter.

### Morale

- If the Bell-Helm is destroyed or taken, the Choir loses discipline and retreats (they stop “performing” and become just another derro pack).

### Loot Notes (Optional)

- If you don’t want the Bell-Helm as loot, it cracks into useless glass when Thrumzok-dum dies (or it retains **1 charge** and then goes inert forever).
