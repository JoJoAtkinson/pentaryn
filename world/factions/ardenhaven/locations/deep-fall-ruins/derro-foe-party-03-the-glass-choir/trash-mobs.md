# Trash Mobs (7) — The Glass Choir

Run these as two squads (Choir Skulkers + Glasscutters). Name them as needed from: [Derro Open Names](../derro-open-names.md).

## Derro Choir Skulker (x4)

- **Light Crossbow.** +4 to hit, 1d8+2 piercing.

**Chime-Shard (1/Day).** A skulker throws a jagged crystal at a point within 20 feet. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 11 Con save or be deafened until the end of its next turn.

**How to run:** Hold angles, focus-fire anyone concentrating, and use Chime-Shard to make the cave feel hostile.

## Derro Glasscutter (x3)

Small humanoid (derro), chaotic evil

**Actions:**  
- **Glass Knife.** +4 to hit, 1d4+2 piercing.

**Cut & Scatter.** If the glasscutter hits a creature with Glass Knife, it can immediately move 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

**How to run:** Run in pairs, stab once, scatter, and bait the party into the hook lane.
