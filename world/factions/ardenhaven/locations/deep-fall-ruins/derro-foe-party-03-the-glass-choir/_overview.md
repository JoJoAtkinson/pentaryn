# Derro Foe Party: The Glass Choir (10)

## Quick Premise

The Glass Choir fight in **echo and silence**: they use ring-chimes, cracked crystal, and a “wizard” whose magic is nothing but a scavenged helm that can *spend sound* like coin.

**Vibe:** surgical, unnerving, controlled. Less “smoke and knives,” more “one wrong step and the cave screams.”

## Party Roster (10)

### The 3 that matter

1) **Thrumzok-dum** (THRUM-zok-dum) — *ringing*  
Role: “Wizard” leader (charged relic: **Resonant Bell-Helm**). Highest level.

2) **Dulgrin-kar** (DULL-grin-kar) — *measured*  
Role: duelist lieutenant (keeps the party pinned in place while the helm spends charges).

3) **Khorvul-dur** (KOR-vull-door) — *hooked*  
Role: chain-hook lieutenant (drags targets into kill-lines).

### The 7 mooks

4–7) **Derro Choir Skulkers (x4)** — optional names: Drakmor-dur, Thar'brum, Khorbad-dum, Drogbar-bor  
8–10) **Derro Glasscutters (x3)** — optional names: Bardrog-dur, Thargrum-dun, (pick one from open list)
