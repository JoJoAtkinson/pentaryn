# Named Derros (3) — The Glass Choir

## Thrumzok-dum — Bell-Helm “Wizard” (lvl 3 vibe)

Small humanoid (derro), chaotic evil

| AC | HP | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 14 (leather) | 24 (6d8 - 6) | 30 ft. |

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 (-1) | 16 (+3) | 8 (-1) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) |

**Saving Throws** Dex +5, Int +4  
**Skills** Perception +3, Sleight of Hand +5, Stealth +5  
**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 13  
**Languages** Dwarvish, Undercommon  
**Proficiency Bonus** +2

### Traits

**Cunning Action.** Bonus action Dash/Disengage/Hide.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** Disadvantage on attacks and sight-based Perception in sunlight.

**Resonant Bell-Helm (8 charges).** A cracked helm of crystal and bronze. When activated, it “rings” without sound—until it spends a charge. Thrumzok-dum can use it only while wearing it. If the helm is taken, he loses access.

### Actions

**Dagger.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing.

**Hand Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing.

### Bonus Actions

**Steady Aim.** If he hasn’t moved this turn, he gains advantage on his next attack this turn.

### Bell-Helm Functions (cross off charges)

These are not “spells” to him; they are **pressure valves**.

- **Silence Cage (2 charges).** Creates a 20-foot-diameter sphere of silence within 60 feet for 1 minute (concentration). (As *silence*.)
- **Shatterburst (2 charges).** A point within 60 feet erupts; creatures in a 10-foot-radius sphere make a DC 12 Con save or take 13 (3d8) thunder damage (half on success). (As *shatter*.)
- **Harmonic Push (1 charge).** 10-foot cone; creatures of Thrumzok-dum’s choice make a DC 12 Con save or take 9 (2d8) thunder damage and be pushed 10 feet away (half damage and no push on success). (As a small *thunderwave*.)
- **Glassguard (1 charge).** Until the start of his next turn, Thrumzok-dum gains +2 AC.
- **Ringmark (1 charge).** One creature within 60 feet makes a DC 12 Wisdom save or can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn (its ears “ring” even in silence).

### Tactics

- If the party has casters: opens with **Silence Cage** and fights around the edge.
- If the party clusters: opens with **Shatterburst** to punish “tight marching order.”
- Uses **Ringmark** to turn off opportunity attacks so Skulkers can reposition.

### Roleplay Handles

- Talks like a conductor: “Hold. Now. Cut.”
- Treats the helm like a sacred instrument; wipes it clean between fights.

**Proficiency Bonus** +2

### Traits

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** +3 (1d6) damage if he has advantage, or if an ally is within 5 ft. of the target and he doesn’t have disadvantage.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.**

### Actions

**Rapier.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing.

**Light Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing.

### Reactions

**Glass Parry (1/round).** Dulgrin-kar adds +2 to AC against one attack that would hit him.

### Tactics

- He exists to *hold* a frontliner in place while the Choir spends charges.
- If he can’t win, he disengages and forces the party to chase into hooks and bolts.

**Hook & Reel (Recharge 5–6).** After hitting a creature with Chain Hook, Khorvul-dur forces it to make a DC 12 Strength save or be pulled up to 10 feet toward him and knocked prone.

### Tactics

- Pulls targets into Skulker lanes or into Dulgrin-kar’s threatened space.
- If the party is winning, he switches to “deny escape” by keeping one PC prone.
