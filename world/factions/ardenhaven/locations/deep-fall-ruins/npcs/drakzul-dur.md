# Drakzul-dur (DRAK-zull-door) — Red Spore Leader (Pusher)

Drakzul-dur’s eyes are empty hollows. He smiles anyway, like it’s normal.

He is not cruel. He is not hateful.

He is simply *certain* the red spores must spread—because certainty is what the spores feel like inside his ribs.

### Traits

**Sunlight Sensitivity.**

**Spore-Sense (No Eyes).** While Drakzul-dur is in a red-spore forest (or within 30 feet of a patch of red mycelium), he has blindsight 60 ft. Outside that range, he is blinded.

**Regenerative Mycelium.** At the start of Drakzul-dur’s turn, if he is within a red-spore forest, he regains 8 hit points. This trait doesn’t function if he took fire damage since the end of his last turn.

**Bound to the Forest.** If Drakzul-dur leaves red mycelium behind, he can survive for up to 1 week, but he is blinded the entire time. When the week ends, he dies and a red-cap growth begins where his body falls.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Drakzul-dur makes two attacks with **Redcap Blade**.

**Redcap Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

**Red Spore Surge (Recharge 5–6).** Drakzul-dur erupts with a 15-foot-radius pulse. Each creature of his choice in the area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the creature is also poisoned until the end of its next turn.

**Spore-Step (2/day).** Drakzul-dur moves up to 20 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. This movement must end in a space within a red-spore forest.

### Bonus Actions

**Cunning Action.** Dash/Disengage/Hide.

## Tactics

- He fights like he’s **taking ground**: push forward, lock you into the red zone, and punish retreat.
- Uses **Spore-Step** to stay inside his forest and keep his “sight.”
- If reduced below half HP, he becomes more desperate but still apologizes.

## Interaction Notes

- If the party offers a way to end the war without destroying either forest, Drakzul-dur listens.
- He believes he is doing the right thing; it feels like duty, not conquest.
- He does not see the green as evil—only as “in the way.”
