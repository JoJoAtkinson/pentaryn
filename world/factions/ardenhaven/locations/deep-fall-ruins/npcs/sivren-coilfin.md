# Sivren Coilfin (SIV-ren KOYL-fin) — the Eel-Back Trader

Sivren is not from the Neogi city. He left.

He is a wandering salesman who runs a “shop” out of two waterproof chests, a hanging net, and a slate board of prices scratched with a bone stylus. His skin is pale and slick, his hair hangs in wet cords, and when he smiles you glimpse teeth that are just a little too sharp.

He sells things you don’t easily get on land—not because they are overtly magical, but because they are **deepwater-specific** and **hard to harvest without dying**.

## What He Sells (Non-Land Goods)

Pick 3–5 items to stock each time the party finds him.

- **Blindfish Ink** — writing ink that dries without smearing in damp air; ideal for maps and spell notes in caves.
- **Brine-Glass Sand** — razor-fine abrasive used to polish lenses, mirror-shards, and delicate mechanisms.
- **Eel-Skin Vellum** — waterproof writing sheet; won’t rot, but feels unsettlingly warm.
- **Salt-Needle Pearls** — tiny jagged pearls used in surgery and precision craft; prized by rare elf lines and meticulous human artificers.
- **Deepwater Resin** — seals cracks in stone and wood; cures even underwater.
- **Black Lake Iodine Salt** — medicinal; stabilizes fatigue and sickness on long delves (tastes vile).

## What He Wants

- New routes. New rumors. New proof that the tunnels are changing.
- Payment in **coin** is fine, but payment in **information** is better.

## If Combat Happens (He Doesn’t Want It)

**Sivren Coilfin**  
Medium humanoid (river-touched half-elf), neutral

### Actions

**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 1d6+2 piercing.

**Brine-Sting Vial (1/day).** One creature within 20 ft. makes a DC 12 Con save or is poisoned until end of next turn.

### Tactics

- Drops a chest between himself and danger and **runs**.
- Offers a bargain mid-fight if it buys him 6 seconds.

## Roleplay Handles

- Friendly in the way of someone who expects betrayal and plans for it.
- Laughs softly when the party says “there’s no way that’s real.”
- Hates fire near his goods. He will leave rather than argue.
