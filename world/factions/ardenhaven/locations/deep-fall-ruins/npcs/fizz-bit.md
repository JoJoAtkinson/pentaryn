# Fizz Bit (FIZZ bit) -- the Separated Spellbook

Fizz Bit is a small gnome wizard who got separated from his adventuring party in the Deep Fall Ruins. He is tired, hungry, and trying very hard to look brave. The closer danger gets, the faster he talks.

He wants to live, get back to the surface, and find his friends. If the party looks even remotely competent, he latches on.

### Tactics (Quick-Run)

- **Before combat (if warned):** cast **mage armor**.
- **Round 1:** if outnumbered, cast **web** to split the fight. If threatened in melee, cast **mirror image** instead.
- **Damage:** **magic missile** to finish low HP targets or when he can't risk missing; cantrips when conserving slots.
- **Escape:** **invisibility** and run to the nearest choke point.
- **Panic tell:** he blurts warnings like, "Don't step there! That's the wrong kind of wet!"

## Interaction Notes

### What the party sees

- A soot-smudged gnome clutching a spellbook wrapped in oilcloth and tied with twine.
- Chalk marks on his sleeves and fingers like he keeps writing distances and forgetting.
- A stubborn attempt to stand on a rock so he's "closer to eye level."

### What he knows (use as clues)

- He got separated during a chase and has been mapping turns by scratch-marks.
- He has heard (not seen) derro arguing in the distance and the wet hiss of neogi speech.
- He has a "safe-ish" hide: a dry ledge above brine where silk-lines don't hang down.

### What he wants

- Escort to a known route out (or to his party's last camp).
- Food, water, and five uninterrupted minutes to re-pack his spellbook properly.
