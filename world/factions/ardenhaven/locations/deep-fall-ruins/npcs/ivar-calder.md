# Ivar Calder (EYE-var CAL-der) — Tower Scribe of “Acceptable” Cruelty

Ivar Calder is not the kind of evil that kicks down doors. He is the kind that **files the paperwork**.

He lives in a lone tower set in a pocket cavern: a small brown-cap forest to one side, a still black lake to the other. His work is framed as *practical*—the sort of thing the **Calderon Imperium** would tolerate, excuse, and quietly expand. The cost is paid by people no one wants to look at too closely.

## What He’s Doing (Why the Party Turns on Him)

Ivar is refining a reagent he calls **Calm-Salt**: a pale mineral crust harvested from lake-stone and spore deposits.

- In small doses it **reduces panic**, eases pain, helps sleep, and steadies the hand (useful for surgery, field medicine, and “peacekeeping”).
- In large doses it **flattens will**: people stop arguing, stop resisting, stop wanting.

His “acceptable” justification:

- the Calderon imperium openly give him test subjects to experement with in exchange of a fully working reagent that can be product in mass. 

The subtle evil:

- His process requires living subjects to “tune” the doses.
- He keeps **notes on how to break a person cleanly**, then put them back into the world looking healed.

## How He Gets Anything Done This Far Underground

Ivar does *not* have easy access to the surface. He doesn’t need it.

Hidden in the tower’s lowest floor is an ancient device he has repaired and repurposed:

### The Calderon Pad

A cracked stone dais engraved with a Calderon seal—an anchor-point that only ever connects to one destination.

- **Destination:** a controlled chamber inside the **Calderon Imperium**.
- **Catch (for the party):** arriving there is not “freedom.” It’s stepping into an empire that will assume you are a thief, spy, or contraband.
- **How Ivar uses it:** he sends sealed crates, written reports, and a small number of “treated” subjects on a schedule.
- **How the party can learn about it:** tower notes reference “dispatch windows,” “arrival audits,” and “Imperial Intake.”

### The Exit Kit (Why It’s Still Tempting)

Ivar keeps a small *escape bundle* near the dais for couriers who panic on arrival:

- **1x invisibility potion** *or* **1x scroll of invisibility** (your choice)
- **1x wax-sealed Calderon pass-tag** (for passing the first checkpoint if someone *talks* instead of sneaks)
- **a folded map** of the first corridor route out of the intake chamber (hand-drawn, incomplete)

This makes the pad a high-risk tool: it’s powerful, but using it forces the party into an entirely different kind of danger.

## Combat Sheet

**Skills** Arcana +6, Insight +4, Investigation +6, Persuasion +5  
**Senses** passive Perception 11  
**Languages** Common, one ancient script (his tower notes)  
**Proficiency Bonus** +3

### Traits

**Prepared Wards.** If combat starts inside his tower, Ivar begins with mage armor already active.

**Tower Familiar (optional).** If you want an extra piece on the board, Ivar has an owl familiar that only exists to give him warning and deliver a note; it won’t fight.

### Actions

**Dagger.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing.

**Calm-Salt Dart (Recharge 5–6).** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn.

### Bonus Actions

**Misty Step (2/day).** Ivar teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

**Shield (3/day).** When hit by an attack or targeted by *magic missile*, Ivar gains +5 AC until the start of his next turn.

### Spell Effects (use 1/round; don’t overthink the list)

Treat these as “buttons” rather than a full spellbook.

- **Hold Person (1/day).** DC 14 Wis save or paralyzed (concentration, up to 1 minute).
- **Suggestion (1/day).** DC 14 Wis save or follow a reasonable-sounding instruction for up to 8 hours (concentration).
- **Ray of Sickness (at-will).** +6 to hit, 2d8 poison; DC 14 Con save or poisoned until end of next turn.

## Tactics

- Tries to **talk first**. If the party is angry, he frames it as “medicine” and “necessary trade.”
- If attacked, he uses **Suggestion** to end the fight without killing (“Put down your weapons and leave my laboratory.”).
- Uses **Misty Step** to keep distance and **Shield** to survive the opening burst.

## Interaction Notes

### What the party sees

- A clean desk. A clean robe. A clean smile.
- A tower that smells of ink, brine, and mushrooms.
- Notes that read like a healer’s journal until the party finds the parts that feel like a jailer’s handbook.

### Voice / cues

- Calm, precise, gentle. Never raises his voice.
- Uses words like “compliance,” “stability,” “necessary dose,” and “acceptable loss.”

### Hooks

- Ivar offers to buy “field samples” from the party (spores, salts, organs) with unnervingly fair prices.
- He will happily point the party at threats—because threats create more “subjects.”
- His tower ledger includes a recurring line item: **“Calderon intake—approved.”** If the party follows that thread, they find the pad.
