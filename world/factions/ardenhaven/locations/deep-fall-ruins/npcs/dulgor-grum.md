# Dulgor-grum (DULL-gor-grum) — the Pit-Deep Claywright

Dulgor-grum is a derro who has gone wrong in the quiet way: he speaks to a half-shaped clay derro like it’s a beloved apprentice, promising it breath and obedience. If anyone approaches, he **assumes they are here to steal his “child”** and attacks without warning.

### Traits

**Cunning Action.** On each of his turns, Dulgor-grum can take a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** Once per turn, Dulgor-grum deals an extra 10 (3d6) damage when he hits with a finesse or ranged weapon attack if he has advantage on the attack roll, or if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and Dulgor-grum doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker Dulgor-grum can see hits him with an attack, he can use his reaction to halve the attack’s damage against him.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Dulgor-grum has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

**Steady Aim (Bonus Action).** If Dulgor-grum hasn’t moved this turn, he can use a bonus action to steady his aim. Until the end of the current turn, he has advantage on his next attack roll.

**Clay-Dust Veil (Recharge 5–6).** Dulgor-grum flings powdered clay in a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on a point he can see within 30 feet. The cloud is heavily obscured until the start of Dulgor-grum’s next turn. Immediately after creating the cloud, Dulgor-grum can take the Hide action (no action required).

### Actions

**Shortsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Dagger.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

**Hand Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions (Quick List)

- Cunning Action (Dash/Disengage/Hide)
- Steady Aim (advantage if he doesn’t move)

### Reaction

- Uncanny Dodge (halve damage from one attack he can see)

### Tactics (How He Gets Sneak Attack Solo)

- **Open from cover:** bonus action **Steady Aim**, then **hand crossbow** (Sneak Attack).
- **If pressured:** use **Clay-Dust Veil** to break line of sight, then **Hide** and reposition.
- **If engaged in melee:** **Disengage** (Cunning Action), move to cover, then Steady Aim next round.
- He prefers to focus-fire whoever looks like they can control him (casters, leaders, healers).

## Interaction Notes

### What the party sees

- A derro crouched in a ring of chalk and broken pottery, hands coated in grey clay.
- A half-formed clay “derro” on a stone slab, dressed in scavenged cloth scraps and tiny talismans.
- He speaks softly to it: apologies, instructions, praise—like it answers back.

### Cues & voice

- Soft, intimate tone when speaking to the clay; sudden barking rage when addressing “thieves.”
- Uses possessive language: “my child,” “my witness,” “my little breath.”
- If anyone comes within 15 feet of the clay figure, he snaps.

### De-escalation hooks (if you want an off-ramp)

- If the party backs away from the clay and offers a “gift” (fresh water, a tool, a scrap of cloth), he might pause for one round.
- If someone swears (convincingly) they are here to “help it wake,” he might allow a single sentence—then demands they prove it by letting him bind a clay mark on them (bad idea).

### Loot / props

- **Clay child** (fragile): a fist-sized core stone wrapped in rune-scratched twine.
- Pouch of powdered clay (explains Clay-Dust Veil), thieves’ tools, small stolen trinkets.
