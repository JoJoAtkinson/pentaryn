# Moksel-dum (MOK-sell-dum) — Green Spore Leader (Defender)

Moksel-dum’s eyes are gone—only black hollows remain. He does not notice. He still looks at you when he speaks.

He is kind in the small ways: he apologizes when he harms you; he thanks you when you spare someone; he tries to keep the weak behind cover. The twist is that none of this saves you from what the spores *need* him to do.

## The Green Spores (What They Want)

They don’t speak. They don’t issue orders.

They *pull* the mind the way hunger pulls the stomach:

- extend the green-cap forest
- protect the living mycelium
- keep the red from choking it out

### Traits

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Moksel-dum has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

**Spore-Sense (No Eyes).** While Moksel-dum is in a green-spore forest (or within 30 feet of a patch of green mycelium), he has blindsight 60 ft. Outside that range, he is blinded.

**Regenerative Mycelium.** At the start of Moksel-dum’s turn, if he is within a green-spore forest, he regains 8 hit points. This trait doesn’t function if he took fire damage since the end of his last turn.

**Bound to the Forest.** If Moksel-dum leaves green mycelium behind, he can survive for up to 1 week, but he is blinded the entire time. When the week ends, he dies and a green-cap growth begins where his body falls.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Moksel-dum makes two attacks with **Mycelial Spear**.

**Mycelial Spear.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage.

**Green Spore Ward (Recharge 5–6).** Moksel-dum releases a soothing cloud in a 15-foot radius centered on himself. Each creature of Moksel-dum’s choice in the area gains 10 temporary hit points, and one condition among frightened or poisoned ends on that creature.

**Entangling Mycelium (2/day).** One creature Moksel-dum can see within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of its next turn. While restrained this way, the creature can’t take reactions.

### Bonus Actions

**Cunning Action.** Moksel-dum can take a bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

## Tactics

- He tries to **protect** before he tries to kill.
- Uses **Entangling Mycelium** to stop a key attacker, then focuses them down.
- Pops **Green Spore Ward** right after taking a big hit to swing the math.

## Interaction Notes

- Soft voice. Careful words. No threats unless forced.
- If the party talks, he asks for help “moving the green line” (expanding the forest) as if it’s just gardening.
- He does not understand that leaving the forest will kill him—he only knows it feels like dying and he must return quickly.
