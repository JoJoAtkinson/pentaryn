# DM Notes — The Shardclaws

## Combat Cheat Sheet (1-page use)

### Default Battlefield Plan

- **Skulkers** start hidden on ledges/behind pillars (crossfire).
- **Bruisers** hold the choke and “herd” PCs into angles.
- **Grumkhor-hammar** stays 30–60 ft. back, spends items early, and retreats behind smoke/obscurement.

### Round 1 Script

- Skulkers: **Hide → shoot** (focus one target).
- Bruisers: **Net / shove / block** the first PC through the choke.
- Grumkhor-hammar: uses **Wand of Magic Missiles** or **Scroll: Fog Cloud** (whichever feels nastier), then orders “**TAKE THEIR HANDS**.”

### Win Condition (Derro)

Down 1 PC fast, take their pack, leave.

### Morale

If Grumkhor-hammar drops, the pack scatters on round +1 (Cunning Action / Disengage / flee).

## Loot Notes (Optional)

- If the party wins, at least 1–2 consumables remain (or the wand is recovered with 1–3 charges).
- If the party loses the loot race, the Shardclaws take something small-but-personal (journal, holy symbol, component pouch, trophy).
