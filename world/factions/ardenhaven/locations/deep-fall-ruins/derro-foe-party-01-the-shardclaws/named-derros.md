| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Traits

**Cunning Action.** Bonus action Dash/Disengage/Hide.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** Disadvantage on attacks and sight-based Perception in sunlight.

**Relic Arsenal.** Grumkhor-hammar can activate the following items. If he is disarmed, he loses access.

**Reliable Sneak (Solo).** If Grumkhor-hammar is hidden, or if he uses **Steady Aim**, he can apply **Sneak Attack (1/Turn)**: +7 (2d6) damage on a hit with a ranged weapon.

### Actions

**Dagger.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing.

**Hand Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing.

### Bonus Actions

**Steady Aim.** If he hasn’t moved this turn, he gains advantage on his next attack this turn.

### Relics / One-Use Items (run like “spell slots”)

Keep this as a checklist and cross off as used:

- **Wand of Magic Missiles (7 charges)** — action; spend 1–3 charges; the usual spell effect.
- **Scroll: Fog Cloud** — action; creates cover so Skulkers can Hide.
- **Scroll: Shield** — reaction; +5 AC until start of his next turn (use once; then it’s gone).
- **Charm: Thunderburst (single-use)** — action; 10-ft. radius, Con save or take 2d6 thunder and be pushed 10 ft. (half/no push on save). (Derro-made trinket; not a spell.)
- **Vial: Grease-Slick (single-use)** — action; 10-ft. square becomes difficult terrain; Dex save or prone when entering/starting there.

### Tactics

- Spends **Fog Cloud** early if he can create a crossfire.
- Uses **Wand** to finish weakened PCs (no attack roll).
- If threatened, he **Disengages** and throws a **Grease-Slick** between himself and the party.

### Roleplay Handles

- Calls his pack “inventory.”
- Praises items, not people: “Good wand. Good bite.”
- If a PC drops: he says, softly, “Now we count what you were.”
