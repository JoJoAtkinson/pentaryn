# Thrumkhor-dum (THRUM-kor-dum)

> A broken dwarven arch yawns into a cathedral-cave. Beyond it: a *forest* of brown mushroom pillars, thick as trees, rising from black water and rust-red stone. Lanterns burn low and amber. The air tastes like wet copper and old dust.

## At a Glance

- **What it is:** The derro’s core city—squatting in an abandoned dwarven hold, built around a vast brown-cap mushroom forest.
- **What it feels like:** A “welcome” that’s practical, not kind. You’re safer *awake* than most places; you’re never truly safe *asleep*.
- **Why it’s (mostly) nonviolent inside:** The derro here don’t act as a united tribe. Everyone is independent enough to start trouble—and paranoid enough to know starting trouble means turning your back on people who might stab you *back*.

## The Law (Such As It Is)

Thrumkhor-dum runs on three rules. Everything else is negotiable.

1. **No Silent Knives in the Street.** Murder inside the city brings reprisals from whoever “owned” the victim’s debts, favors, and secrets.
2. **Pay the Gate-Tally.** Visitors are recorded (crudely). If you vanish, someone profits. If you cause a mess, someone collects.
3. **Blood is Bad for Trade.** Violence is allowed *only when it’s seen*—formal brawls, witnessed duels, public punishments. Hidden killings are what the city actually fears.

## Districts (Use as Encounter Zones)

1. **The Browncap Canopy** — the mushroom forest itself
   - Bridges of scavenged timber; spore fog in the low places.
   - Sounds carry oddly. A whisper can become a rumor in minutes.
2. **Old Vault Row** — dwarven storehouses turned into stalls and “inns”
   - Everything is salvaged, traded, or stolen—often all three at once.
3. **The Sporeward** — fungus pits, compost pits, and “medicine” kitchens
   - Where derro alchemists and cooks make useful things out of rot.
4. **The Chisel-Halls** — intact dwarven corridors, half-repaired
   - The closest thing to civic order: scribes, tally-keepers, and watchers.
5. **The Sinkstairs** — steep routes down into the older, wetter city
   - Where the city *wants* you to get lost.

## How Strangers Are Treated

- **In-town:** You get watched, priced, and tested—but not usually stabbed outright. A living customer is a repeat customer.
- **Outside-town:** Derro “adventuring parties” operate like predators. They specialize in ambush, trick bargains, and stealing anything that looks enchanted or expensive.

Use this as a consistent social rule:

- In the **city**, derro compete with each other through deals, leverage, and humiliation.
- In the **wilds**, derro cooperate long enough to rob you.

## Resting Here (If You Dare)

- **Short rest:** Possible, but expect interruptions (offers, threats, “help,” theft attempts).
- **Long rest:** Only with a **watch**. If the party beds down unguarded, something gets taken—or someone wakes up with a “tally mark” they didn’t have before.

Optional complications (pick 1):

- A room is “safe” only if you let a tally-keeper record a debt token (a favor owed later).
- Spores cause vivid dreams; a PC wakes with a true memory that isn’t theirs (derro gossip or dwarven echoes).
- A friendly host tries to sell the party’s itinerary to a derro raiding crew.

## What PCs Can Get Here

- **Guides** through the Deep Fall Ruins (unreliable, but useful).
- **Salvage trade** (coins are fine; secrets are better).
- **Rumors** (true and false) about:
  - derro foe parties and patrol routes (see: `../derro-foe-party-01-the-shardclaws/_overview.md`, `../derro-foe-party-02-the-gloomcinders/_overview.md`)
  - the Neogi below (see: `kazzjakn-silk-cistern.md`)
  - “quiet tunnels” where the mushrooms don’t grow (and why that’s worse)

## Encounters (Quick Table)

Roll or choose:

1. A derro merchant offers a bargain that’s *too* good—then asks for a favor “of equal weight.”
2. Two derro argue over who owns a prisoner’s debt; the “prisoner” tries to escape into the party.
3. A public duel begins on a bridge above the Browncap Canopy; watchers place bets loudly.
4. A spore-cook offers the party “sleep broth” (it works; the dreams are the price).
5. A derro scout returns injured—claiming a tunnel ahead is “full of clean stone” (ooze warning).
