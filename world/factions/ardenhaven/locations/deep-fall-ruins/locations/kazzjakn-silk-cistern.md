# K'azz'jak'n Silk Cistern (KAZH-jak-EN SILK SIS-tern)

> The stone sweats brine. Ropes of pale silk hang like wet curtains. Somewhere in the dark, something *hisses* a greeting that sounds like a knife dragged across glass—then offers you fish as if this is the most normal thing in the world.

## At a Glance

- **What it is:** A Neogi hive-city built into a flooded cistern-chasm beneath the Deep Fall Ruins; part silk-works, part salvage dock.
- **What it looks like:** Old stonework kept improbably intact by webbing—silk stitched across cracks like tendon; curtains of thread from arch to arch.
- **Tone:** Transactional, unsettlingly cordial, and *alien*—everything is measured in favors, “nest-debts,” and silk. Outsiders call it monstrous; those who know it call it safe enough.
- **Naming note:** Neogi names follow the `K'azz'jak'n`-style rules in `../../../../naming_conventions/primary-factions.md`.

## Getting There

Pick one (or use all as “routes” the party can discover):

1. **The Brine Crack:** A narrow fissure where salt water seeps upward; crawling leads to a rope-bridge overlook.
2. **The Flood Channel:** A half-submerged tunnel that forces slow movement and threatens to split the party.
3. **Derro Trade Stair:** A hidden stairwell the derro use for “safe” exchanges—safe only because violence costs profit.

## Districts (Quick Map)

Use these like encounter zones; each name is a place-name the neogi would actually use.

1. **Ssak'vash (ssak-VASH)** — *The Tether Market*
   - Ledger-stalls, trade chits, silk-seals, and “tether-tags” used to mark **guests and companions** (a practice many surfacefolk find deeply off-putting).
2. **Kazz'gru (KAZH-groo)** — *The Brine Pits*
   - Flooded basins, fish pens, brine baths, and reed-traps; the city’s food and water are managed like a careful equation.
3. **Zhak'sik (ZHAK-sik)** — *The Silkworks / Hatchery*
   - Warm, humid chambers; silk-lines; egg racks; hatchling tunnels too small for Medium PCs.
4. **Xul'drak (ZULL-drak)** — *The Salvage Dock*
   - A crude mooring ledge where weird wreckage is hauled up: broken hull-planks, plated doors, alien scrap.
5. **Qath'keth (KATH-keth)** — *The Gate*
   - A narrow choke with a toll-post and a “peace line.” Cross it and you are “in debt.”

## Who Rules Here

- **The Brood Council:** Three adult neogi “keepers” who speak in ledger-terms and enforce **city peace** through rules, reputation, and mutual risk.
  - **Kazz'vrulix (KAZH-vrul-IKS)** — keeper-of-accounts; calm voice, unnerving arithmetic.
  - **Qath'zhul (KATH-zhull)** — keeper-of-trade; never stops smiling with too many teeth.
  - **Skra'jakhkz (SKRA-jakh-kz)** — keeper-of-silk; impatient, exacting, always ink-stained.
- **The Great Old Master (inert):** A massive, immobile “elder” creature kept deep below in a sealed vault of silk and stone. The neogi treat it as both shrine and engine of legitimacy.

## What Lives Here (and Why It’s Dangerous)

- **Neogi patrols** are small and confident: they fight like people who expect the room to belong to them—and who would rather escort you out than kill you.
- **Guests and “companions”** live among the neogi by choice (or necessity): surfacefolk, underfolk, and drifters who found the city’s strict safety preferable to the Ruins.
  - The neogi understand they’re intelligent and treat them with a strange, careful respect—but also speak of them the way someone might speak of a beloved animal: *cute*, *soft*, *kept safe*.
- **Environmental hazard:** slick stone, hanging silk-lines (difficult terrain), brine pools, and sudden drops.

## How the Neogi Fight (DM Notes)

- **Open with control:** nets, silk-lines, and “pin them to the bridge” tactics.
- **Keep talking during combat:** they negotiate *while* they fight (“You are unsafe. Stop. Accept escort.”).
- **Escalation lever:** if the party escalates, the council calls in more patrols; if the party de-escalates, neogi try to **separate**, **bind**, and **remove** intruders—not kill them.

## Loot & Trophies

- Spider-silk rope (light, strong, unsettlingly warm)
- Tether-tags (useful as “keys” to certain doors and ledgers; wearing one may get you treated like “someone’s responsibility”)
- Salvage scrap from Xul'drak: odd metal plates, rune-stamped hinges, a cracked lens that “wants” moonlight

## Hooks

- A derro party “paid” for something they should not have—now the neogi want the party to return it before it breaks the city’s peace.
- Someone the party needs is in Ssak'vash—**nested** under a false name, and reluctant to leave a place that (mostly) doesn’t hunt them.
- The Deep Fall Ruins have started *leaking silk* into upper tunnels; it’s not natural, and it’s spreading.
