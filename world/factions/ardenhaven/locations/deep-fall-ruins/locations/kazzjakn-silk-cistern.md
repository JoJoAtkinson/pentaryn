# K'azz'jak'n Silk Cistern (KAZH-jak-EN SILK SIS-tern)

> The stone sweats brine. Ropes of pale silk hang like wet curtains. Somewhere in the dark, something *hisses* a word that sounds like a knife dragged across glass—and chains answer it.

## At a Glance

- **What it is:** A Neogi hive-city built into a flooded cistern-chasm beneath the Deep Fall Ruins; part silk-works, part slave-market, part salvage dock.
- **Tone:** Transactional, cruel, and *alien*—everything is measured in debt, chains, and silk.
- **Naming note:** Neogi names follow the `K'azz'jak'n`-style rules in `../../../../../naming_conventions/primary-factions.md`.

## Getting There

Pick one (or use all as “routes” the party can discover):

1. **The Brine Crack:** A narrow fissure where salt water seeps upward; crawling leads to a rope-bridge overlook.
2. **The Flood Channel:** A half-submerged tunnel that forces slow movement and threatens to split the party.
3. **Derro Trade Stair:** A hidden stairwell the derro use for “safe” exchanges—safe only because violence costs profit.

## Districts (Quick Map)

Use these like encounter zones; each name is a place-name the neogi would actually use.

1. **Ssak'vash (ssak-VASH)** — *The Chain Market*
   - Auction platforms, slave tags, debt-scribes, iron cages on winches.
2. **Kazz'gru (KAZH-groo)** — *The Brine Pits*
   - Flooded basins, drowning pens, leech vats; where “uncooperative” stock is softened.
3. **Zhak'sik (ZHAK-sik)** — *The Silkworks / Hatchery*
   - Warm, humid chambers; silk-lines; egg racks; hatchling tunnels too small for Medium PCs.
4. **Xul'drak (ZULL-drak)** — *The Salvage Dock*
   - A crude mooring ledge where weird wreckage is hauled up: broken hull-planks, plated doors, alien scrap.
5. **Qath'keth (KATH-keth)** — *The Gate*
   - A narrow choke with a toll-post and a “peace line.” Cross it and you are “in debt.”

## Who Rules Here

- **The Brood Council:** Three adult neogi “masters” who speak in ledger-terms and enforce obedience through fear and *ownership*.
  - **Kazz'vrulix (KAZH-vrul-IKS)** — broodboss; calm voice, cruel arithmetic.
  - **Qath'zhul (KATH-zhull)** — auction-master; never stops smiling with too many teeth.
  - **Skra'jakhkz (SKRA-jakh-kz)** — silkwright; impatient, violent, always ink-stained.
- **The Great Old Master (inert):** A massive, immobile “elder” creature kept deep below in a sealed vault of silk and stone. The neogi treat it as both shrine and engine of legitimacy.

## What Lives Here (and Why It’s Dangerous)

- **Neogi patrols** are small and confident: they fight like people who expect the room to belong to them.
- **Thralls and stock** do the labor (and often the dying). If you want muscle, use enslaved brutes; if you want dread, use chained victims who *beg* the party not to make things worse.
- **Environmental hazard:** slick stone, hanging silk-lines (difficult terrain), brine pools, and sudden drops.

## How the Neogi Fight (DM Notes)

- **Open with control:** nets, poison, and “drag them off the bridge” tactics.
- **Keep talking during combat:** they negotiate *while* they kill (“Your debt is small. Stop resisting.”).
- **Escalation lever:** if the party wins too fast, a council member orders thralls in; if the party loses momentum, neogi try to **capture**, not kill.

## Loot & Trophies

- Spider-silk rope (light, strong, unsettlingly warm)
- Slave tags (useful as “keys” to certain doors/cages)
- Salvage scrap from Xul'drak: odd metal plates, rune-stamped hinges, a cracked lens that “wants” moonlight

## Hooks

- A derro party has “paid” for something they should not have—now the neogi want the party to deliver the rest of the debt.
- Someone the party needs is in Ssak'vash—sold under a false name.
- The Deep Fall Ruins have started *leaking silk* into upper tunnels; it’s not natural, and it’s spreading.
