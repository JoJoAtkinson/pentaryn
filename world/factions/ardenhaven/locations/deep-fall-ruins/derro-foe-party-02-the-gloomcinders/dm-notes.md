# DM Notes — The Gloomcinders

## Combat Cheat Sheet

### What makes them feel different

- Their “wizard” runs off **one charged lantern** (not a scroll bandolier).
- They fight to **remove sight** first, then punish anyone who separates.
- They prefer **dragging** and **restraining** over raw damage.

### Default Battlefield Plan

- Start the fight with a **dark pocket** (lantern effect) placed to split the party.
- Skulkers stay at 30–60 ft. and shoot into the edges of visibility.
- Hook Bruisers hold the choke and pull a target into the dark pocket.

### Round 1 Script

1) **Grumdrak-dum:** Lantern → **Umbral Bloom** (darkness pocket) or **Dread Glare** (fear cone) based on terrain.
2) **Dulmok-grum:** throws caltrops/ball bearings, then Hides.
3) **Brogthar-kar + Bruisers:** hook/drag the first overconfident PC into the dark.
4) **Skulkers:** focus-fire whoever is isolated.

### Morale

- If the lantern breaks (or Grumdrak-dum drops), the pack loses the nerve for “clean kills” and retreats into tunnels.

### Loot Notes (Optional)

- The lantern is the prize; if you don’t want it as loot, it cracks and becomes mundane when Grumdrak-dum dies.
