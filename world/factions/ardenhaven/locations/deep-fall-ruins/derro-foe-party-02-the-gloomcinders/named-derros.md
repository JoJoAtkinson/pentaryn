# Named Derros (3) — The Gloomcinders

## Grumdrak-dum — Lantern “Wizard” (lvl 3 vibe)

Small humanoid (derro), chaotic evil

| AC | HP | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 14 (leather) | 24 (6d8 - 6) | 30 ft. |

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 (-1) | 16 (+3) | 8 (-1) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) |

**Saving Throws** Dex +5, Int +4  
**Skills** Deception +2, Perception +3, Stealth +5  
**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 13  
**Languages** Dwarvish, Undercommon  
**Proficiency Bonus** +2

### Traits

**Cunning Action.** Bonus action Dash/Disengage/Hide.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** Disadvantage on attacks and sight-based Perception in sunlight.

**Lantern of Umbral Script (10 charges).** This fist-sized lantern drinks light and writes moving runes in the smoke. Grumdrak-dum can use it only while holding it. If the lantern is taken, he loses access.

### Actions

**Dagger.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing.

**Hand Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing.

### Bonus Actions

**Steady Aim.** If he hasn’t moved this turn, he gains advantage on his next attack this turn.

### Lantern Effects (cross off charges)

These are not “spells” to him; they are **functions**.

- **Umbral Bloom (2 charges).** Create a 15-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness within 60 feet for 1 minute (concentration). Grumdrak-dum can see through it.
- **Dread Glare (2 charges).** 15-foot cone; creatures of Grumdrak-dum’s choice make a DC 12 Wisdom save or become frightened of him until the end of their next turn.
- **Sootstep (1 charge).** Grumdrak-dum teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see that is in dim light or darkness.
- **Sickening Script (1 charge).** One creature within 60 feet makes a DC 12 Con save or is poisoned until the end of its next turn.
- **Veil the Pack (3 charges).** Up to 3 derro of his choice within 60 feet become invisible until the start of Grumdrak-dum’s next turn (ends early if they attack/cast/activate a relic).

### Tactics

- Opens with **Umbral Bloom** to split the party.
- Uses **Veil the Pack** once the party commits to a direction.
- Uses **Sootstep** to stay out of melee and keep the lantern safe.

### Roleplay Handles

- Speaks in inventory terms: “two charges left,” “light is expensive.”
- Hates bright flames; points at torches like they’re insults.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.**

### Actions

**Shortsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing.

**Light Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing.

**Pocket Hazards (2/Day).** Dulmok-grum throws either **caltrops** or **ball bearings** into a 10-foot square within 20 feet (no action economy tracking beyond 2/day—use whichever is nastier).

### Tactics

- He doesn’t rush; he **waits** for a PC to chase and then makes the chase miserable.
- He uses hazards to keep targets inside the lantern’s darkness.
