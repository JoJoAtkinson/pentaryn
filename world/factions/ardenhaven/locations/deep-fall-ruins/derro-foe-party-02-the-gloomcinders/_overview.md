# Derro Foe Party: The Gloomcinders (10)

## Quick Premise

The Gloomcinders fight in **bad light**: ash, soot, and a lantern that drinks color from the air. Their “wizard” doesn’t carry a belt of scrolls—he carries **one relic** with many charges and treats it like a god he can *spend*.

**Vibe:** quiet, suffocating, methodical. Less “pack of knives,” more “smoke that learns.”

2) **Dulmok-grum** (DULL-mok-grum) — *patient*  
Role: trapper lieutenant (funnels PCs into darkness).

3) **Brogthar-kar** (BROG-thar-kar) — *brutal*
