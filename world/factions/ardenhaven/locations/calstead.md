## Description

Calstead sits in the fertile plains northeast of [Ardenford](ardenford/ardenford.md), surrounded by fields of wheat and barley that stretch to the horizon. The village is simple: a single main road lined with farmhouses, a communal granary, and a water-powered mill that grinds grain for the surrounding homesteads.

Life here follows the seasons. Planting in spring, tending through summer, harvest in fall, and quiet winters spent repairing tools and preparing for the next cycle. Most families have farmed these same plots for generations.

## Economy

- **Primary Export:** Grain (wheat, barley, oats) shipped to Ardenford markets
- **Secondary:** Flour from the mill
- **Trade:** Weekly market where locals trade preserved foods, tools, and livestock

## Notable Locations

- **The Mill:** Water-powered, maintained by the Brightwater family for three generations
- **Community Granary:** Shared storage for harvest; protected by locked doors and village watch
- **Market Square:** Weekly gathering on seventh-day; mostly locals, occasional traveling merchants

## Key NPCs

- **Reeve Wolfton** (Human, early 50s) - Village leader; manages land disputes and tax collection for Ardenford
- **Miller Brightwater** (Human, late 40s) - Operates the mill; respected for fair prices and honest measure

## Hooks & Rumors
