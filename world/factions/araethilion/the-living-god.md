# The Living God

Elaerith (eh-LAIR-ith) is a living god—seen, obeyed, and worshipped in the same breath. To the Ardenites, she is both sovereign and savior, trading their devotion for long life and a promised path to the eternal planes.

The oldest elves cannot name a time without Elaerith's light, woven into the first songs of creation. She appears forever in her prime, and every portrait captures the same serene face.

Those who are touched by Elaerith's divinity channel their powers directly from her. This is not a metaphor or a belief—it is literal. Clerics draw their divine magic from their living god through a connection established in the **Lifebloom Ritual**, which transforms them into conduits of her power.

## The Lifebloom Ritual

The Lifebloom Ritual is not a common ceremony. It is not something performed monthly in village squares or sung in choruses at regional gatherings. The Lifebloom is sacred, intimate, and reserved for one purpose alone: binding the Silver Thread between Elaerith and those she chooses to touch with divinity.

At the ritual's center stands Elaerith herself. She does not delegate this work. She cannot. The connection is too personal, too deeply woven into her essence to be performed by proxy. Each elf who receives the Silver Thread kneels before her alone—no witnesses, no congregation, no shared moment. It is the most important event of their entire life, and it belongs to them and Elaerith alone.

The ritual is brief but overwhelming. Elaerith places her hands over the supplicant's heart and speaks words that are felt more than heard. Warmth spreads through the chest—not painful, but impossibly full, as if the heart has been opened and filled with light. The Silver Thread takes root in that moment, invisible but undeniable. When the supplicant rises, they are changed. They can feel Elaerith in the back of their thoughts, a constant presence, neither intrusive nor distant. She is there. Always.

For the broader population—those who are not Divinely Touched—participation in the faith is expected but far less intense. Common citizens are encouraged to attend regional ceremonies at least once every decade, rituals of gratitude where they sing hymns, offer small tokens, and reaffirm their devotion. These gatherings are communal, celebratory, and open to all. But they are not the Lifebloom. They do not create the Silver Thread. They are expressions of faith, not bindings of power.

The distinction matters. To be called to the Lifebloom Ritual is to be chosen. To attend a regional ceremony is simply to remain faithful. Both are honored, but only one transforms you forever.

## The Myth of Omniscience

Common Ardenites believe Elaerith is all-knowing. The Divinely Touched understand a more nuanced truth: she requires them to report events and observations to maintain her awareness of the world.

Elaerith's power is so vast that drawing from her wellspring goes unnoticed. Individual clerics channel divine magic without attracting her direct attention—she is the reservoir, and they are the streams.

This means clerics can act independently. Elaerith will not know unless they report or unless she specifically seeks them out through the Silver Thread. Some see this as freedom. Others see it as a test of loyalty.

## Time Without Growth

### Court-Bound Clerics

Clerics living within Elaerith's courts experience subjective time differently. Centuries can pass while they tend the same corridor. Emotional maturity stalls; obedience calcifies. Decision-making rarely evolves because any true choice is deferred upward. "Interpretation" means discovering which precedent best fits her last whispered decree.

**At the table:** A Divinely Touched cleric can easily be level 1 despite having existed for centuries. They may have spent 100s of years never venturing beyond temple walls, never facing danger—only ritual.

### Field Clerics

Not all Divinely Touched serve in the courts. Field clerics are granted the Silver Thread and sent out to minister in villages, travel with caravans, or serve as itinerant healers. They age normally (or nearly so) and experience time like other mortals. For them, the connection is a calling, not a cage.

A newly empowered field cleric might be young—barely twenty summers—touched by Elaerith after demonstrating devotion during a regional ceremony. Or they might be a former court servant released into the world after decades of preparation, finally allowed to act rather than observe.

**At the table:** A field cleric is more grounded, more worldly, but still bound by their vow to report and serve. They carry the weight of knowing they are being watched—even if Elaerith does not always look.

*Whether in the courts or in the field, all who serve Elaerith navigate the same structure of proximity and power.*

## The Courts—The Nine Rings of Proximity

1. **Field Devotees:** Farmers, artisans, soldiers who attend seasonal rites.
2. **Chorus Offerers:** Lead hymns, maintain local shrines.
3. **Petal Acolytes:** Novices permitted inside the outer temple gardens.
4. **Dawn Cantors:** Liturgical specialists who guide regional ceremonies.
5. **Verdant Stewards:** Administrators overseeing ceremony logistics.
6. **Moon Veil Clergy:** Trusted messengers who carry Elaerith's blessings—relics, edicts, and prepared rites.
7. **Radiant Custodians:** *(Paladins & War Clerics)* Guardians of Elaerith's palace approaches.
8. **Inner Court Seraphs:** Advisors who spend decades within the twilight halls.
9. **Divinely Touched:** *(Clerics)* Personal conduits; beauty unnerving even among elves, lifespans that blur into millennia.

Closeness to the living god does not translate cleanly into personal power. The Rings measure proximity, favor, and usefulness, not fairness. Some stand nearer because they have served for centuries; others because they were born to the right parent or happened to please Elaerith in a single, pivotal moment. A child of a Divinely Touched who begged Elaerith to bind their offspring as well is called a **Favor-Born**—a cleric by petition, not by proving. This is accepted as natural, if quietly resented. In Araethilion, access is not just what you earn. It is who you know, and whether the living god chooses to smile on you.

## Taboos, Heresies & Sins

The faithful know what not to ask. Questioning Elaerith's divinity is the gravest heresy—to suggest she is anything less than eternal, anything less than divine, invites immediate Severance. Even the Divinely Touched who understand her limits speak only in careful euphemisms: "She guides us to report so we may share in her awareness," never "She does not know unless we tell her."

Skipping a required regional ceremony without temple dispensation is a sin of omission. The ill and the distant are excused, but willful absence marks you as selfish, unwilling to give back what Elaerith has given in blessing and years. Repeat offenders are called before their local shrine and asked to confess in front of the congregation. Most do. Those who refuse find their neighbors suddenly cold, their trades suddenly difficult.

Hoarding personal vitality—refusing the cup, attempting to block the flow through the Silver Thread—is seen as spiritual theft. You have taken Elaerith's gifts (long life, health, beauty) and now refuse to sustain the bond. Clerics suspected of this are brought before temple magistrates. If the accusation is proven, Severance follows swiftly.

Practicing foreign worship within Araethilion is not forbidden outright, but it is deeply suspect. To honor another god suggests Elaerith is insufficient. Missionaries are tolerated with icy politeness and escorted to the border within days. Citizens who adopt foreign rites are not punished—merely watched, questioned, and quietly excluded from higher rings of service.

Minor infractions—lateness to ritual, improper hymn phrasing, neglecting shrine upkeep—are met with public confession circles. You kneel before your community, speak your failure aloud, and receive their forgiveness. It is humiliating but brief. Severance is reserved for those who threaten the faith itself: heretics, apostates, and those who would sever others from Elaerith's light.

## Severance & Consequences

Elaerith cannot sever the Silver Thread from a distance. The connection is too deeply woven, too literal, to unravel with a thought or a decree. The accused must be brought before her—bound, escorted, or walking willingly—and made to kneel. Only then, in her presence, can she perform the undoing of the Lifebloom Ritual, unweaving what was once bound thread by thread.

The experience is comparable to the most severe withdrawal. The moment the Silver Thread is severed, the cleric feels it—a hollow tearing behind the ribs, as if their heart has been scooped out and the space left cold and empty. Overwhelming loneliness follows, an extreme sense of isolation that does not fade even when surrounded by others. You are in a crowded room, and you are alone. You are speaking, and no one hears. The world is there, but you are not part of it.

Many do not survive Severance. The body weakens rapidly without Elaerith's sustaining flow. Some collapse within hours. Others linger for days, hollow-eyed and unresponsive, before their hearts simply stop. The Divinely Touched who have lived for centuries often die the fastest—their bodies too accustomed to the thread to remember how to sustain themselves without it.

The social consequences depend entirely on Elaerith's mood. If she is forgiving, Severance is temporary—a punishment, not an execution. She allows the condemned to kneel and suffer for seconds, sometimes minutes, tasting what eternity without her will feel like. Then she restores the thread. The relief is immediate and overwhelming. Most who experience this never stray again.

Redemption is not heard of—not true redemption. If Elaerith restores the thread, it is because she always intended to. The Severance was theater, a lesson, a reminder of her power. No one has ever earned their way back after true exile.

And what happens to those who survive the withdrawal? No one knows. It is assumed survival is possible because Elaerith sometimes allows the severed to leave her domain alive, escorted to the borders and released. But they are never seen again. Whether they wander until they collapse, whether they find solace elsewhere, whether they live or die—no one in Araethilion can say. The faithful do not speak of them. It is as if they never existed at all.

## Social Standing & Privileges

There is no nobility in Araethilion. There are no lords, no hereditary titles, no bloodlines that claim authority by birth. There is only Elaerith and the Rings of Proximity. Power flows from closeness to her—literally. The nearer you stand to the living god, the more comfort, influence, and years you are granted. A Field Devotee in the outermost ring may live a long and blessed life. An Inner Court Seraph may live for centuries, ageless and serene. A Divinely Touched may blur into millennia, their beauty unnerving even among elves.

Only Elaerith can judge a cleric. No court, no magistrate, no council has authority over the Divinely Touched. If a senior cleric witnesses a younger one straying—speaking heresy, neglecting their duties, acting with cruelty—they may counsel them, steer them back toward the light. But punishment? Discipline? That belongs to Elaerith alone. To claim otherwise is to claim her authority, and that is heresy.

This does not breed arrogance as much as it breeds caution. Every cleric knows they are watched—not by peers, but by the one who holds their thread. To act poorly is not to risk arrest; it is to risk Severance. The threat is absolute, and it keeps most in line.

The faithful do not fear clerics. They revere them. A cleric's arrival in a village is celebrated—healings are performed, blessings are given, disputes are mediated with divine insight. Even field clerics, young and uncertain, carry Elaerith's light. To see one is to see proof that the living god has not abandoned you. Farmers kneel. Children are brought forward for blessings. Offerings are made—not out of obligation, but gratitude.

Court clerics, those who dwell in the inner rings, are treated with even deeper awe. They are living proof of Elaerith's favor, their beauty almost painful to look upon, their voices soft and certain. When they speak, it is assumed they speak for her. Few would dare question them.

## Relationship to Other Gods & Religions

Other gods exist. The faithful do not deny this. Travelers bring stories of distant deities and the world is vast enough to hold many powers. But the Ardenites do not care.

The reasoning is simple and absolute: if these other gods truly cared for the elves of Araethilion, they would be here. They would walk among them. They would touch their hearts directly, as Elaerith does. They do not. Therefore, they either lack the power, lack the will, or fear to descend to the mortal plane. Elaerith does none of these things. She is here. She is real. She is present.

Foreign missionaries are treated with polite indifference. They are offered hospitality, escorted to clean lodgings, provided food and basic courtesy. But when they begin to preach, they find no foothold. The population listens with the patience reserved for confused children. They nod. They smile. They do not convert. Why would they? They have a living god who blesses them personally, who grants long life and divine power with her own hands. What can a distant deity offer that compares?

Most missionaries leave within weeks, frustrated or heartbroken. A few stay longer, hoping persistence will break through. It never does. Eventually, they are politely reminded that their welcome has limits, and they are escorted to the border.

Clerics can acknowledge other deities without committing heresy—so long as they frame them correctly. Other gods are lesser or distant. They may be powerful in their own realms, but here, on this plane, among mortals, they are absent. Elaerith is not. A cleric might say, "Yes, your god may watch from the heavens, but mine walks the realm. Yes, your god may answer prayers, but mine answers me directly." It is not blasphemy to acknowledge other powers. It is simply truth: none of them are here, and Elaerith is.

## For Players

**Make the character you want to play.** If you're unsure how your concept fits into the Divinely Touched, send me a note and we'll figure it out together.

This background offers structure, not a script. Your character can start as a true believer—faithful, obedient, certain in Elaerith's light. That's a compelling story. But remember: **heroes rarely become heroes by staying within the lines.** Growth happens when characters are tested, when certainties crack, when the world demands more than doctrine can answer.

You are not required to play the "ideal cleric" described here. In fact, the most interesting stories often come from characters who struggle with what they've been taught, who ask dangerous questions, who choose compassion over protocol or truth over tradition. The faith has rules. Your character doesn't have to follow them perfectly—or at all, depending on where their journey takes them.

Play someone real. Let them grow. Let them doubt, stumble, rebel, or surprise you. That's where the story lives.
