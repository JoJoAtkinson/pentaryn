# Aeralithil (AIR-ah-LITH-il)

> Sacred heart-city beneath the Veiled Crown.

- Culture: Elven (Araethilion)
- Type: Capital city
- Faction: [Araethilion](../_overview.md)

## Description
Aeralithil is a radiant forest capital where living temples and songwoven halls encircle Elaerith’s courts. Beauty and abundance mask a harsher truth: proximity to the living god is privilege, and the threat of Severance keeps the faithful compliant.

## Points of Interest
- The Veiled Court — the inner rings of proximity, where access is power
- Lifebloom Hall — where the Silver Thread is bound in intimate rite
- Whisper Galleries — dissident circles trading rumors of exile, Severance, and forgotten names

## Adventure Hooks
- A field cleric returns claiming their Silver Thread has “frayed,” and the court wants silence.
- A dissident choir begs safe passage for a singer marked for “voluntary pilgrimage.”
- A rumor spreads that someone survived Severance and came back.
