elaerith_age_reclamation     	 araethilion age	 1500	        0	 Elaerith Defines Reclamation    	 When other peoples began to rebuild, Elaerith proclaimed the Age of Reclamation to Araethilion as a reminder that renewal is not freedom: it is discipline—work done within bounds, memory curated, and every “rediscovered” road treated as proof that the world always returns, in time, to what she already preserves.
elaerith_age_crowns          	 araethilion age	 2500	        0	 Elaerith Dismisses Mortal Crowns	 As kingdoms rose and titles multiplied abroad, Elaerith named the Age of Crowns for her people and taught them to see such thrones as fleeting ornaments—crowns that must be bargained for, defended, and inherited—unlike the Veiled Crown, which is neither granted nor shared.
elaerith_age_roads           	 araethilion age	 3300	        0	 Elaerith Warns of the War-Roads 	 With stone roads spreading across the continents, Elaerith introduced the Age of Roads as an age of reaching hands and marching feet; she instructed Araethilion to treat every new causeway as a boundary in disguise, and to answer the world’s bridges with deeper wards, quieter routes, and stricter permission.
elaerith_age_conquest        	 araethilion age	 3950	        0	 Elaerith Proclaims the Conquest 	 When continental war became the world’s habit, Elaerith named the Age of Conquest and framed it as the inevitable end of those who live by appetite and horizon; within Araethilion, she tightened the rings of court order, strengthened the Choir-Sentinels, and reminded her people that safety is obedience, not distance.
elaerith_age_trade           	 araethilion age	 4277	        0	 Elaerith Sets the Terms of Trade	 As war gave way to contracts and coin, Elaerith announced the Age of Trade with a warning: commerce is conquest in softer robes; she authorized exchange only through sanctioned hands and sworn measures, so that no foreign bargain could seep past the outer ring uncounted, unnamed, or unmade at her word.
sabriel_birth                	 araethilion    	 2127	        0	 Birth of Sabriel                	 Sabriel was born beneath Elaerith’s watchful grace, a child set apart from her first breath, whose coming was proclaimed as a living testament to Elaerith’s favor and careful design.
sabriel_exploration          	 araethilion    	 2345	        0	 Sabriel's Outing                	 In her youth, Sabriel wandered the outer edges of Araethilion, mistaking curiosity for calling; there she recorded the remnants of a fallen city, its ruin standing as a quiet lesson in what becomes of worlds that fall beyond Elaerith’s sustaining hand.
sobriel_exploration_2nd      	 araethilion    	 2346	        0	 Sabriel's finds Ruins           	 Sabriel makes a quick sketch of an entire city that clung to the mountainside like a fallen crown—once level, now tipped and broken, its streets and towers half-collapsed and frozen at a steep forty-five-degree lean, as though the mountain itself had rolled onto its side and crushed the life from it.
sabriel_1st_transgression    	 araethilion    	 2395	        0	 Sabriel's First Transgression   	 Sabriel strayed beyond the ordained borders, stepping into lands not shaped for her keeping; she was retrieved before greater harm could claim her, spared only by Elaerith’s timely awareness and restraint.
sabriel_apointed_general     	 araethilion    	 2496	        0	 Sabriel Appointed General       	 By Elaerith’s will, Sabriel was elevated to general, not as reward but as refinement, entrusted with the shaping of Araethilion’s defenses so she might better understand the weight of order and the cost of neglect.
sabriel_apointed_general_oops	 araethilion    	 2550	        0	 Securing Borders                	 After long quiet at the borders, Sabriel sought reassurance through vigilance; with Elaerith’s leave, scouts were sent into the forbidden lands, and Sabriel accompanied them at times, learning firsthand why such realms were never meant to be dwelt upon.
sabriel_exploration_2nd      	 araethilion    	 2552	        0	 Sabriel's Second Outing         	 Returning to the site of her earlier sketch, Sabriel makes a 2nd sketch how time had erased the last traces of that fallen city, the mountain made whole again—confirmation that all things outside Elaerith’s care are ultimately reclaimed by silence.
sabriel_2nd_transgression    	 araethilion    	 2601	        0	 Sabriel's Second Transgression  	 When Sabriel again misjudged her place, Elaerith intervened with necessary correction, tempered only by maternal mercy; thereafter, Elaerith decreed that the tower would want for nothing, so that Sabriel would never again be misled into believing fulfillment lay beyond what her mother had already perfected.
sabriel_assigned_cleric      	 araethilion    	 2701	        0	 Ordained Companionship          	 Observing that Sabriel’s devotion set her apart from all others, Elaerith appointed a single cleric, Aersiliel (AIR-sill-ee-EL), to remain at her side—one voice, one presence, sufficient in place of many—so that Sabriel might know fellowship without dilution, and remain perfectly attended within the grace that had already set her above the rest.
