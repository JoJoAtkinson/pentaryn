# Khargun-dur (KHAR-gun-DOOR)

> Oathforged mountain citadel.

- Culture: Dwarven (Dulgarum — Oathbound Holds)
- Type: Capital city
- Faction: [Dulgarum-Oathholds](../factions/dulgarum-oathholds.md)

## Description
Carved into a mountain spine, Khargun-dur’s oath vaults and breachgates seal ancient tunnels. The citadel’s prosperity masks a bleeding, secret war.

## Points of Interest
- Oath Vault — reliquary of binding pacts and clan seals
- Breachgates — armored doors to the deep
- Stoneward Anvils — forgeworks humming with defensive contracts

## Adventure Hooks
- A breached tunnel disgorges something the oaths cannot name.
- A clan seeks to amend an oath that’s killing its heirs.
- Evidence suggests supply trains go deeper than the defenses.
