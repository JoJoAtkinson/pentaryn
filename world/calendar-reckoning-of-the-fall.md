# The Reckoning of the Fall

The world measures time from the collapse of Ao Sathanum (AY-oh sah-THAH-noom), the ancient empire whose ruins still hum with dangerous magic. Everything is dated from that cataclysm: **1 A.F.** (After the Fall) marks the first year after the empire's destruction.

The current year is **4,327 A.F.**

The Pentarch Accords—the treaties that ended the Imperial Wars and reshaped the modern world—were signed in **1,200 A.F.**, a mere 127 years ago.

---

## The Year

A year has **360 days**, divided into **12 months of 30 days each**.

Each month is named in the tongue of the Ancients—words of symmetry and vowel-song that predate every living culture. Scholars believe these names were ritual markers in Ao Sathanum's calendar, though their original meanings are now lost or disputed.

| Month # | Name           | Pronunciation       | Season/Character           |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| 1       | Arumel         | ah-ROO-mel          | First Thaw (early spring)  |
| 2       | Veleara        | VEH-leh-AH-rah      | Green Rise (spring)        |
| 3       | Lumaeos        | loo-MAY-ohs         | Brightening (late spring)  |
| 4       | Thaeorum       | THAY-oh-rum         | High Sun (early summer)    |
| 5       | Aoruvan        | AY-oh-roo-vahn      | Harvest Flame (midsummer)  |
| 6       | Voraela        | voh-RAY-lah         | Long Light (late summer)   |
| 7       | Ulemar         | OO-leh-mar          | First Chill (early autumn) |
| 8       | Saraenos       | sah-RAY-nohs        | Reaping (autumn)           |
| 9       | Ithraeum       | ITH-ray-oom         | Falling Dark (late autumn) |
| 10      | Arethum        | ah-RETH-oom         | Frost Lock (early winter)  |
| 11      | Morvalos       | mor-VAH-lohs        | Deep Cold (midwinter)      |
| 12      | Aneumos        | ah-NOO-mohs         | Year's End (late winter)   |

### Ancient Name Patterns

These month names follow the linguistic rules of Ao Sathanum:
- **Vowel-heavy**: 60–70% vowels for flowing, ritual sound
- **Proto-root `ar`**: Appears in several names (Arumel, Veleara, Saraenos, Arethum)
- **Ancient endings**: `-os`, `-um`, `-eum` mark them as distinctly pre-modern
- **Symmetry**: Some names echo themselves (Veleara, Morvalos, Aneumos)

---

## The Week

A week is **6 days**, called a **span**.

Each month has exactly **5 spans** (5 weeks × 6 days = 30 days).

Days of the span are numbered, not named:
- **First Day** through **Sixth Day**
- Or simply: **1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th**

In common speech, people say:
- "I'll see you on Third Day next span."
- "Market day is always Fifth Day."

---

## Writing Dates

Dates are written in this order: **Day | Month | Year A.F.**

**Format:** `[Day] [Month Name] [Year] A.F.`

**Examples:**
- `15 Veleara 1327 A.F.` — 15th day of Veleara (spring), year 1,327 after the Fall
- `3 Arethum 1200 A.F.` — 3rd day of Arethum (early winter), the year the Accords were signed
- `28 Aoruvan 1 A.F.` — 28th day of Aoruvan in the first year after Ao Sathanum fell

**Shorthand (for notes/logs):**
- `15.V.1327` — Month represented by number (Veleara = 2nd month)
- Or: `15/2/1327` — Day/Month-number/Year

---

## Before the Fall

For dates before the collapse of Ao Sathanum, the system uses **B.F.** ("Before the Fall").

Counting goes backward from year 1:
- `1 B.F.` — the year immediately before Ao Sathanum fell
- `50 B.F.` — fifty years before the Fall
- `500 B.F.` — five hundred years before the Fall

**Example:**
- Ao Sathanum is believed to have been at its height around `200 B.F.`, with its collapse occurring over several decades leading to year 1 A.F.

## Seasons

The 12 months naturally fall into four seasons:

| Season       | Months                          | Character                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Spring**   | Arumel, Veleara, Lumaeos        | Thaw, planting, renewal               |
| **Summer**   | Thaeorum, Aoruvan, Voraela      | Heat, growth, long days               |
| **Autumn**   | Ulemar, Saraenos, Ithraeum      | Harvest, cooling, preparation         |
| **Winter**   | Arethum, Morvalos, Aneumos      | Cold, darkness, endurance             |

---

## Age & Lifespans

When giving ages or lifespans, use **years** (the same as "A.F." but without the designation):

- "She's 23 years old."
- "Elves can live 700 years or more."

When referencing history, always use the A.F. system:
- "The Imperial Wars ended in 1,200 A.F."
- "That ruin dates back to at least 800 B.F."

---

## Historical Context

### Key Dates in A.F. Reckoning

- **1 A.F.** — The Fall of Ao Sathanum; the ancient empire collapses
- **~200–400 A.F.** — The Scattering; surviving cultures migrate and establish early settlements
- **~600 A.F.** — First dwarven holds delved; elven enclaves founded
- **~900 A.F.** — Rise of early human kingdoms
- **1,150–1,199 A.F.** — The Imperial Wars; Calderon Imperium expands aggressively
- **1,200 A.F.** — The Pentarch Accords signed; modern political order established
- **1,327 A.F.** — Current year

---

## Cultural Variations

### Humans (Ardenhaven, Calderon, Merrowgate, Elderholt)
- Follow the A.F. calendar exactly
- Most common folk know the current year as "the 1,327th year since the Fall" or simply "this year"
- The Accords (1,200 A.F.) are a more emotionally significant date for most living humans

### Elves (Araethilion)
- Use the same months and A.F. system for external communication
- Internally, elven scholars keep parallel records of their own histories that predate the Fall by millennia
- Some elder elves remember the last days of Ao Sathanum

### Dwarves (Dulgarum, Garhammar)
- Use the A.F. calendar for external trade and treaties
- Internally, each hold keeps its own "Founding Count" from when their clan first delved that mountain
- Many dwarven holds were founded 600–800 A.F.

### Orcs (Garrok, Rakthok)
- Garrok Confederation adopted the A.F. calendar as part of their treaties with Ardenhaven
- Rakthok Horde does not formally use it; shamans track time by "winters survived" and "visions received"
- Oral traditions speak of "the time before the Fall" as a mythic age

---

## Why This Calendar Matters

The A.F. system is a constant reminder that the current age is built on the ruins of something far older and more powerful. Every time someone writes a date, they acknowledge:
- **Ao Sathanum fell** — and its magic still lingers
- **The modern world is young** — barely over a millennium old
- **The Accords are recent** — only 127 years of fragile peace

The ancient month names, still used despite their lost meanings, are a daily invocation of a power no one fully understands—a quiet ritual the living perform without knowing why.

*This calendar anchors the world in the shadow of the Ancients. Every date is a countdownor a count-upfrom the moment their empire shattered, and the modern age was born from its ashes.*
