Bazgar tried to sneak in to reach the victims but got stuck in the webs and drew the spider’s
attention. Rather than immediately fighting, the party used magic to communicate and intimidate the
spider into leaving the camp. While checking the egg cluster afterward, a spiderling hatched and
attacked, but it was quickly killed and the remaining eggs were burned. The party cut down both
cocooned workers—one stable, one near death—and Sabriel used magic to stabilize the critical
survivor. They searched the camp, confirmed no other spiders were present, recovered the camp’s
tools, and prepared to transport the rescued workers back to Gareth Thorne for payment."""
