## Session Management

### Recording Sessions
1. Use `/templates/session-notes-template.md`
2. Save to `notes/` with naming: `session-XX-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Fill out during or immediately after the session
4. Link to characters, locations, and quests involved

### Planning Sessions
1. Use `/templates/session-planning-template.md`
2. Save to `planning/` with naming: `session-XX-planning.md`
3. Prepare encounters, NPCs, and story beats
4. Review player hooks and pacing

### Best Practices
- Number sessions consistently
- Include date played
- Track XP and loot awarded
- Note cliffhangers and unresolved threads
- Link to related quests and locations
- Update character information after significant events

## Session Numbering

Use consistent numbering:
- `session-01-2024-03-15.md`
- `session-02-2024-03-22.md`
- etc.
