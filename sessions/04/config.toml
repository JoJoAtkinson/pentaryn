# D&D Session 2 Configuration

[session]
# Session number is auto-detected from folder name (sessions/02 = session 2)

# Recording source affects speaker identification reliability
# Options: "in-person" (single mic), "discord" (separate recordings), "hybrid"
recording_source = "in-person"


# Speaker identification notes (helps LLM understand speaker labels)
[session.speakers]
# All speakers labeled as UNKNOWN due to poor diarization quality
# Speaker identification must be inferred from context by LLM

UNKNOWN = "Could be any of the 4 participants - see notes below for context"

# Additional context for LLM speaker identification
notes = """
CRITICAL: All speakers in this transcript are labeled UNKNOWN because automatic 
diarization was unable to reliably separate voices. The LLM must infer speaker 
identity from conversational context.

4 PARTICIPANTS:
1. Nicole - plays Sabriel (female cleric/healer character)
2. Kris - plays Marwen (female witch character from Elderholt)  
3. Jeff - plays Bazgar (male dwarf barbarian character)
4. Joe - Dungeon Master (narrates story, voices all NPCs, describes scenes)

SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION CLUES:
- Joe (DM): Narrates environmental descriptions ("You see...", "The room is..."), 
  speaks for multiple NPCs, asks "What do you do?", describes dice results, 
  significantly more talkative than any player
  
- Nicole (Sabriel): Speaks as Sabriel in first person ("I heal...", "I cast..."),
  mentions healing/clerics/divine magic, references Alaris connection
  
- Kris (Marwen): Speaks as Marwen in first person, mentions witches/Elderholt,
  discusses ward-witches vs deep-witches, references magical bargains or Elder Marith
  
- Jeff (Bazgar): Speaks as Bazgar in first person, mentions barbarian abilities/rage,
  dwarf-related references, throwing axes, physical combat

In-person recording with single microphone makes voice separation very difficult.
