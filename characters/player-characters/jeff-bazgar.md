## Overview

Bazgar, son of Bazrak, is the much-undershadowed younger brother of Ghorrak the First Striker, Chosen Warlord of the Rakthok Horde. Young and perhaps foolish, Bazgar seeks to make a name for himself in lands far from home. Despite moderate successes in training and his first raids, he could never measure up to Ghorrak, who has 15 years of combat experience over him. Bazgar is certain the war cannot be won the way it is currently fought and left his home to seek answers, strength, and reputation. If Ghorrak is to be replaced by someone with a better plan, Bazgar must become that someone.

## Appearance

At 6ft tall, Bazgar is average in size for an orcish male. He has a lean build, but with tight strong muscles and a grace to his movements that seems un-orcish to outsiders. His features are more delicate than most orcs, almost elflike, leading many both at home and abroad to underestimate him. It also makes him pretty hot. Since he doesn’t have the physique to inspire fear that his older brother has, he relies on his more unusual traits, and as such wears his hair asymmetrically, with it shaved to fuzz on the left side and a set of thick braids running down to his shoulders. He has a bird-skull earring on his pointed left ear and two obsidian studs in his right. He wears a relatively light shirt of black iron chain with a red open vest of leather lined with rabbit fur, hempen trousers also lined with fur, a leather belt that is tied off with no buckle, and knee-high leather boots of rugged and durable make. His axe is beared with a wicked curve and made of the same black iron as his chain. He also bears a shield, a wooden targe covered in stretched alligator leather with an alligator skull ringed by two spirit-flames painted in white on its face.

## Personality

- **Traits:** Laugh in battle and in all things, for it might be the last time you do! I will rise to any challenge you make, and I will not back down. Act as if you are strong and you will be strong. Make a choice. Commit with everything you have, and do not look back. Gold is a soft metal, only good for bragging that you have nothing useful to offer.
- **Ideals:** Death to the Heart-Marked and their evil Imperium! I will be the strongest of all so that no one else has to be. I would give my life to defend a spirit-place from desecrators.
- **Bonds:** I am Bazgar, son of Bazrak, brother of Ghorrak, of the Dakmar’nak!
- **Flaws:** Question my honor and lose some teeth. Caution is for those without duty. Blood for blood, tusk for tusk.

## Backstory

Bazgar, son of Bazrak, is the much-undershadowed younger brother of Ghorrak the First Striker, Chosen Warlord of the Rakthok Horde. Despite his own moderate successes in training and his first raids, Bazgar could never possibly measure up to Ghorrak, and most found it impossible not to compare the two. Unfair, perhaps, because Bazgar is only barely a young man and his brother has had 15 years of combat experience over him, but nevertheless true.

It isn’t because Bazgar is a poor fighter or strategist. It’s not even because he doesn’t even match up to Ghorrak’s might at that same age (though of course he doesn’t). In fact, if he would close his damn mouth and stop insisting that the war was being fought the wrong way he’d probably lead a normal life among the Dakmar’nak, fighting with the rest of the warriors as an equal.

But Bazgar is certain the war cannot be won the way it is currently fought. The enemy is using the orcs as a source of recruits- they are gaining in power from our battles, and we are not. Moreover, they are not even wielding the power they are gaining! It goes to another purpose, one we would be wise to learn.

He could never convince his brother, however. To Ghorrak, what mattered was the war before him, not the motivations of the enemy or their dealings with the dead. The Ancestors fought the war in this way with the Spirits as their guide, and no one was to argue with that wisdom. So Bazgar, less devout than his brother, left his home and his tribe to seek answers and to build his strength and his reputation. If Ghorrak is to be replaced by someone with a better plan, he needs to figure out that plan and become that someone, and that’s going to take some incredible strength and skill- strength and skill he definitely does not yet possess. But who knows, maybe he’ll kill a dragon or rescue a sacred spirit-place and Ghorrak will finally acknowledge his strength.
