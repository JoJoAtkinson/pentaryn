They say I was reborn in the fire. What I remember is the smell of burning straw, the crackle and pop of timber giving way, the sensation of it gnawing at my skin. Then, relief, the scent of smoke, the sound of my mother’s cries, and the bite of winter air. That was when everything changed. My name is Marwen Ashcroft. They call me the Reborn because it remade me when I declared who I was.

When my mother surrendered me to the coven, the elders argued for days. Boys are never taken; their tempers twist it into something eager for ruin, but the fire had already unraveled whatever I had been. The Axiom recognized me as its own. I was threaded, and I grew into the shape it gave me. I learned early how rare I was and I tried to be the perfect witch they wanted in return.

I have always admired my sister for managing that kind of certainty effortlessly. Clair moves through the world as if her path was clearly marked. Even as a child she mumbled prophecies in her sleep, spouted rhymes that made the elders fall silent. When she earned her first ward-markings, pride burned through me. I still hope the runes I bear someday will be worthy of her.

Now my time in Elderholt is ending. Threadlings leave once we have outgrown the covens’ teachings. We wander the world until experience hardens our will and we return only when it grows too loud for us to face alone. My first destination is Ardenhaven. There are ruins there, old as the Axiom. It’s where Clair went when she left home. Maybe I’ll find some echo of her path waiting for me.

Marwen Ashcroft is the daughter of Breann, a Votary witch who had her thread strengthened but, through fear, never struck a single true bargain. Perhaps it is because of this that both of her daughters were claimed.

Clair is Marwen’s older sister by a few years. She demonstrated powerful Sight from an early age and has undergone the path of a ward-witch as a result. She is now a Tollbearer, having struck her first real bargain. Marwen looks up to her, wants to be just like her. How Clair actually feels about Marwen, well, I’ll leave that open to your imagination if they do cross paths in the wider world.

Marwen is trans. She was born male but an early encounter with the Voice led to that fact changing, her old form burned away by fire that she unknowingly started, and reformed into who she is now. It was a big deal among the coven and hotly debated before testing her. The main argument for is that her will is strong enough that knowing she was a girl, made it so. The concern is that it was done so through a means as violent as fire. The fact that Marwen seems to have an aptitude for more destructive magic doesn’t help matters. Her moniker of “the Reborn” is as much slander as a point of pride.

Marwen wants to be a ward-witch, wants to focus on the sight and defense, stand against the darkness, but her aptitudes and history make her a more natural deep witch. Whether she sticks with her dreams or finds a reason to pursue darker secrets, we will find out through play.

Her initial quest is to explore a set of ruins in the vicinity of Ardenhaven and begin her exploration of the world. She is naturally overly cautious and not used to being on her own. She walks between the shadows of her mother and sister with the grace of one who wants to belong so badly she's afraid to breathe too loudly.
