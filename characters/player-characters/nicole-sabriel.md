My character pitch: "What it's like to be God's favorite"

Now called Sabriel, I am the fourth descendant of a family line born and dedicated to our godly mother, Elaerith. One with such an exalted pedigree is expected to achieve great honors and deeds. Alas, as I have learned, to stumble from great heights is to fall at great velocity. The first of my transgressions, faulty judgement and the tendency to err on the side of radical thoughts. Eventually alienating half of my peers. 

However, with Elaerith's mercy, a second chance was given to me by the Goddess herself. Appointed General and charged with defending a city of lesser importance to Araethilion. This city no longer stands. Further testament to those who would voice opinion against me. 

For many years after I remained kept confined to Her courtyards and palace, reputation shattered, yet kept closer to Her still. Elaerith's grace bestowed to me for reasons she has never shared. My petitions to venture out into the world long ignored or rejected, it came as a surprise that I was called to travel out once more. Humbled but elated, my journey begins with the hope of finding new companions who do not carry the memories of distant days.
