## Appearance & Physical Presence

Sabriel is slender and unassuming, standing at a height of 5'9". By default, they carry an easy, confident air—graceful and naturally still, comfortable in any environment. They tend to fall to the back of the party and observe, allowing others to step forward and take action first. This watchful patience speaks to their years of experience and the hard-earned wisdom of a fallen general.

Sabriel's face could be considered perfection to an elf: high, sharp features and skin that is unblemished and fair. However, they are warm and perpetually amused, their expression of humor contrasting sharply with their cold and aloof kin. Their eyes are a dark, almost black, holding depths of experience earned over millennia.

Their hair changes color with their mood—most often, it is a soft green jade, long and straight. They wear it half down and half tied back with thread or ribbon. Their traveler's clothes are simple and white, practical for the road. When occasion demands, they still possess robes of office with fine embroidery, remnants of their former rank.

## Personality & Temperament

**Character Concept:** "What it's like to be God's favorite"

Sabriel has a tendency toward faulty judgment and errs on the side of radical thoughts, which eventually alienated half of their peers. Despite their failures, they maintain their status as someone close to the goddess Elaerith.

**Emotional Temperament & Typical Mood**

Sabriel's temperament is best understood through contrasts. Compared to their elven kin, they would be considered impulsive—but measured against the party and the wider world, they are remarkably slow and deliberate in their decision-making. They don't get upset easily, maintaining an even keel through most situations. Their typical mood is contemplative and optimistic, always observing, often taking a supporting role rather than stepping forward to lead.

**Sense of Humor**

Sabriel's sense of humor is perpetual. They're always looking for amusement in everyday situations—this is how they've managed to stay sane over such a long lifetime. They see humor in just about anything, though not necessarily in a dark way. Their view on finding humor in tragedies remains uncertain; time will tell how their levity holds up in the face of true darkness.

**Handling Stress & Conflict**

Sabriel has a fairly high stress tolerance—things don't disturb them very much. When faced with stress, they tend toward avoidance; after all, they did seek to run away from the stressful situation at home. 

When it comes to conflict, particularly violent conflict, Sabriel will actively avoid it due to their prior military background. They have developed a distaste for violence and unnecessary life-taking. That doesn't mean they're incapable of it—they simply require stronger motivations to engage. The capability remains; the willingness has been tempered by experience and regret.

**Social Tendencies**

Sabriel is fairly amicable and looks to make friends, especially since they feel like they didn't have that many before. Whether this perception matches reality is unclear, but it shapes how they engage with others. Among those who don't know their past, they find freedom to be seen for who they are now rather than who they failed to be.

**Fears**

Sabriel's greatest fear is internal and complicated: they fear there is no real reason for Elaerith to love them. Even though logically they understand that being chosen as a favorite isn't something they earned—that favoritism isn't necessarily merited—the fear persists. They're fairly self-aware about this paradox.

The relationship with Elaerith is codependent, at least on Sabriel's part. They certainly want to be loved by their goddess, but they fear they may not actually be, or fear being discarded someday. The cruel irony is that their actions—their restlessness, their radical thoughts, their tendency toward faulty judgment—will likely lead them down that very path to being discarded. And they know it.

**Insecurities**

TODO: To be discovered through play.

**Current Strengths & Moral Compass**

Sabriel possesses a very even temperament and is more inclined to do good than to do bad. Their moral compass, shaped by 2,500 years of life and hard lessons, points toward compassion tempered by pragmatism.

TODO: This section will expand as Sabriel's character develops through play.

## Voice & Manner of Speaking

**Speech Patterns & Pace**

Sabriel speaks in carefully chosen phrases with a noticeable delay in their responses. They think fairly slowly—not a particularly intelligent character—and prefer to consider their words before speaking. This manifests as a deliberate, measured way of speaking, though currently (just weeks after their escape) they're running at a higher energy level than usual, speaking faster due to excitement over new experiences and people.

From their military background, they've retained the habit of conveying information efficiently rather than being long-winded. They get to the point, but they take their time getting there.

**Vocabulary Level**

Sabriel has a very broad range of vocabulary through sheer exposure over 2,500 years, but they don't necessarily have deep understanding of complex words. They know many words; they don't always grasp the full nuance of all of them.

**Tone & Demeanor**

Their tone of voice is soft and conciliatory—not aggressive in the slightest. They're not pushy, though they do have more backbone than a customer service worker. They'll speak their mind and stand up for their opinions, but they won't force the issue. In verbal arguments, they often let people think what they want to think rather than pressing their point.

Sabriel is a humble character now, not a prideful one. This humility comes through in how they speak.

**Verbal Quirks & Habits**

Sabriel has trouble moving quickly between conversational subjects. Often, they'll bring up a point or respond to something after everyone else has already moved on to the next topic. This can create moments of social awkwardness as they're still processing the previous discussion while the party has shifted gears.

**Expressing Emotion**

Sabriel has no conflict expressing their emotions plainly. If they're upset, they'll simply state it: "That upsets me." However, their tone won't necessarily match the emotion they're describing—they might say they're upset without sounding particularly upset. Their emotional expression is more declarative than demonstrative.

**Current State**

Years of confinement haven't de-socialized Sabriel—they've always had people to talk to. However, being just weeks out from their escape, there's a high level of energy and excitement still coming through. They're thrilled to see new things and meet new people, which makes them communicate a bit faster than their natural baseline. This heightened state will likely settle over time as the novelty fades and they find their true rhythm again.

## Background & History

### Early Life & Formative Years

Sabriel is called "the fourth descendant of a family line born and dedicated to our godly mother, Elaerith." One with such an exalted pedigree is expected to achieve great honors and deeds.

TODO: Describe their childhood, family relationships with the other three descendants, early training, and what shaped them before their appointment as General.

### Key Turning Points

**First Transgression - Appointment as General:**

Sabriel's first transgressions were faulty judgment and the tendency to err on the side of radical thoughts, eventually alienating half of their peers.

However, with Elaerith's mercy, a second chance was given by the Goddess herself. Sabriel was appointed General and charged with defending a city of lesser importance to Araethilion.

**The Fall - Loss of the City:**

Acting in their role as appointed general, after years of quiet duty, Sabriel grew restless. Seeking a clearer understanding of their security and early warning of any threat, they ordered scouts into the forbidden lands. On occasion, they accompanied the scouts themselves to see those outer realms firsthand.

The loss of the city serves as further testament to those who would voice opinion against Sabriel. It was a fall from great heights at great velocity.

## Relationships & Connections

### Party Members

TODO: Describe relationships with other PCs as they develop. Sabriel seeks companions who don't know their past.

### Important NPCs & Connections

**Elaerith (Godly Mother):** The goddess to whom Sabriel's family line is dedicated. Elaerith has shown Sabriel mercy repeatedly - giving a second chance after their first transgressions, keeping them close even after the city fell, and now sending them back into the world. Her reasons for continuing to favor Sabriel have never been shared. The nature of their relationship is complex - divine parent, patron deity, and source of both opportunity and confinement.

**The Family Line:** Sabriel is the fourth descendant of a line dedicated to Elaerith. TODO: Who are the other three descendants? What is their relationship with Sabriel? Do they resent the continued favor shown to someone who has failed?

**Former Peers:** Half of Sabriel's peers were alienated by their radical thoughts and faulty judgment. TODO: Are any of these relationships salvageable, or do they represent burned bridges?

### Faction/Group Ties

**Araethilion:** The elven realm/society Sabriel comes from. 

**The Forbidden Lands:** Sabriel ordered scouts into these lands and went there themselves. TODO: What are these lands? What did they find there? Did what they found contribute to the city's fall?

## Skills & Capabilities (Narrative)

Sabriel was appointed General, indicating military leadership, strategic thinking, and likely combat capability. Their decision to personally accompany scouts suggests they are capable in field operations, not just command.

They have experience with security assessment, early warning systems, and defensive strategy.

Their "radical thoughts" suggest unconventional strategic thinking, which may be either a strength or a dangerous tendency depending on application.

TODO: Describe specific combat abilities, magical capabilities if any, tactical expertise, and how these skills reflect who they are as a person after 2,500 years of life and their time in confinement.

---

## Quirks, Habits & Mannerisms

TODO: Describe physical mannerisms (do they still carry themselves like a general?), behavioral habits (from years of confinement?), pet peeves, triggers (mentions of the lost city? questions about Elaerith's favor?), comfort behaviors, and distinctive quirks that make this ancient elf feel real.

---

## Beliefs & Values

Sabriel values understanding threats and taking proactive measures (ordering scouts into forbidden lands for early warning). They are willing to take risks and make unconventional decisions, even when this has backfired catastrophically.

They maintain devotion to Elaerith despite not understanding why she continues to favor them.

TODO: Expand on their worldview after 2,500 years, religious beliefs beyond devotion to Elaerith, political or social beliefs (what made their thoughts "radical"?), what lines they won't cross now after their failures, and how their experiences shape their decisions. Have they become more cautious, or does the restlessness still drive them?
