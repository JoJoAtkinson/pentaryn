Gareth is a broad-shouldered man in his late 50s with graying hair and a well-trimmed beard. He has a warm smile and kind eyes, though a jagged scar runs along his left forearm - a reminder of his adventuring days. He typically wears a clean apron over simple, sturdy clothing.

- **Bonds:** The Rusty Dragon is his life's work and pride

## Backstory

Gareth spent his youth as an adventurer, exploring dungeons and fighting monsters alongside his party. After a close call with a dragon left him scarred and his best friend dead, he retired from adventuring. Using his savings, he purchased and renovated what was then a run-down tavern, transforming it into the Rusty Dragon - Sandpoint's premier inn.

For the past 20 years, he's been serving travelers, locals, and the occasional adventurer passing through town. He has a soft spot for adventurers, often offering them discounted rates and sage advice from his own experiences.
