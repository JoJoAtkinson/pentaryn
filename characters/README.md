# Characters

This directory contains all character information for the campaign.

## Structure

- **player-characters/** - Player character sheets and information
- **npcs/** - Non-player characters the party has met or may meet

## Creating a New Character

1. Copy the template from `/templates/character-template.md`
2. Fill in all relevant sections
3. Save to the appropriate subdirectory:
   - Player characters go in `player-characters/`
   - NPCs go in `npcs/`
4. Use kebab-case for filenames: `character-name.md`

## Character Organization Tips

- Keep character sheets updated after each session
- Link characters to related locations, quests, and other characters
- Track character development and major story moments
- For NPCs, note when the party last interacted with them
