## Quest Summary

Local farmer Eldon Thornbrook has been experiencing nightly goblin raids. His crops are being destroyed, livestock stolen, and his family is terrified. He's offering a reward to anyone who can stop the raids.

## The Hook

> Gareth leans in close as he refills your drinks. "Heard old Eldon was in town today, looking mighty worried. Says goblins have been raiding his farm every night for the past week. Lost half his chickens and they trampled a good portion of his wheat field. He's offering coin to anyone brave enough to put a stop to it. Interested?"

Players might also hear about it from:
- Town notice board
- Other farmers discussing it
- Local militia captain

## Objectives

- [x] Learn about the goblin attacks from Eldon or Gareth
- [ ] Travel to Thornbrook Farm
- [ ] Investigate the farm and previous attack signs
- [ ] Prepare defenses or set an ambush
- [ ] Defeat or drive off the goblins
- [ ] Optional: Track goblins to their lair
- [ ] Optional: Rescue stolen livestock

## Background

A small goblin tribe from the Brinestump Marsh has become bolder recently. Their chieftain, Kretch, has been leading raids on farms to steal food and supplies. Thornbrook Farm was targeted because it's isolated and seemed like an easy target.

The goblins attack at night, usually around midnight. There are 6-8 goblins in the raiding party, led by Kretch. They approach from the south, using the tall grass for cover.

## Key NPCs

- **[Eldon Thornbrook](../../characters/npcs/eldon-thornbrook.md):** Farmer, worried about his family (human, age 45)
- **Kretch:** Goblin chieftain, cowardly but cunning (will flee if losing)
- **Goblin Raiders:** 6-8 goblins, poorly equipped but numerous

## Locations

### Thornbrook Farm
Small farm with a house, barn, chicken coop, and wheat fields. The farm is surrounded by wooden fencing (easily climbed). Good sight lines from the house.

Fields show signs of damage - trampled wheat, broken fences, chicken feathers everywhere.

### Approach from Marsh
Goblins come from the south through tall grass. Potential ambush site.

## Encounters & Challenges

### Combat Encounters

1. **Goblin Raid (Planned):** 
   - 6 Goblins + Kretch (goblin boss)
   - Arrives around midnight
   - Goblins split up - 3 to chicken coop, 2 to fields, 1 with Kretch watching
   - Easy encounter if party prepares an ambush
   - Medium encounter if caught unprepared

### Skill Challenges

1. **Investigation:** DC 12 Survival to track goblin approach path and find their trail
2. **Perception:** DC 10 to hear goblins approaching in the night
3. **Stealth:** DC 13 to remain hidden while setting ambush
4. **Persuasion/Intimidation:** DC 15 to make Kretch talk if captured

## Quest Progression

### Stage 1: Investigation
**Status:** Not Started

Party travels to farm, talks to Eldon, investigates signs of previous raids.

**What to find:**
- Goblin footprints leading south
- Torn cloth caught on fence (goblin clothing)
- Timing of attacks (always near midnight)

### Stage 2: Preparation
**Status:** Not Started

Party decides how to handle the situation:
- Set ambush
- Fortify farm
- Track goblins proactively
- Request militia help (takes 1d4 days)

### Stage 3: Confrontation
**Status:** Not Started

Either goblins raid and party responds, or party tracks them down.

### Stage 4: Resolution
**Status:** Not Started

Return to Eldon/Gareth with news of success.

## Possible Outcomes

### Success
Goblins defeated or driven off. Farm is safe. Eldon is grateful and pays reward.

### Partial Success
Some goblins escape but raids stop. Partial reward. Hook to goblin lair remains.

### Failure
Party unable to stop raid, goblins continue attacks. Eldon may need to abandon farm.

## Rewards

### Primary Rewards
- Gold: 50 gp from Eldon (25 gp up front, 25 gp on completion)
- Items: Eldon offers 2 weeks of free room and board at his farm
- Experience: 150 XP per character (600 total)

### Optional Rewards
- If livestock recovered: +1 Potion of Healing from Eldon
- If goblin lair found and cleared: Additional 100 XP + treasure

### Reputation & Consequences
- +1 reputation in Sandpoint
- Eldon spreads word of party's heroism
- Other farmers may request help with similar problems

## Timeline & Urgency

Low urgency but ongoing threat. Each day party waits, Eldon loses more resources. After 1 week, family may abandon farm.

## Alternative Solutions

1. **Direct Combat:** Ambush the raiders at the farm
2. **Tracking:** Follow goblin trail to their lair and eliminate threat at source
3. **Defense:** Fortify farm so goblins can't get in (they'll give up after 2-3 failures)
4. **Negotiation:** Capture and interrogate Kretch, possibly negotiate with tribe
5. **Call for Help:** Get militia involved (takes longer but safer)

## Connected Quests

- **Future Quest:** "The Goblin Lair" - tracking raiders to Brinestump Marsh
- **Related Issue:** "Missing Merchant" - goblin tribe may be responsible

## DM Notes

### Preparation Checklist
- [x] Goblin stat blocks (MM p.166)
- [ ] Farm map (simple sketch okay)
- [ ] Kretch personality: Cowardly but cunning, speaks broken Common
- [ ] Loot: 1d6 sp per goblin, Kretch has 15 sp and small jade (10 gp)

### Improvisation Guide

If party:
- **Tracks goblins immediately:** They find a small camp 1 mile south (3 goblins resting)
- **Requests help:** Militia sergeant offers 2 guards after 1d4 days
- **Tries to befriend goblins:** Kretch is open to bribes (food/shiny objects)
- **Sets elaborate trap:** Reward clever planning with advantage on initiative

### Secret Information

- Kretch's tribe is acting bolder because their usual food source (fish from marsh) has dried up
- A larger goblin warband is forming in the region (hint at larger threat)
- Kretch has a map showing locations of several other farms (potential future targets)
